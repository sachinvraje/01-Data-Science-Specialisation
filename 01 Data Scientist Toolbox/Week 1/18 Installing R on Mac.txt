In this video, I'm going to to briefly
show how you can install R on the Mac. It's a very simple process. You just have to, it only takes a few
steps. So the first thing you need to do is open
your web browser, and go to cran, says the
comprehensive R archive network. So you can just type in cran here, [SOUND] and you'll see that, [COUGH] there are a
number of options for you to download here for different platforms, and
so we're going to download the Mac platform
here. So we go to download R for the Mac. And you see that the latest version here,
is version 3.0.3. You want to download this package file
here, so just click on this, and you'll see that the download
meter will start going. And it might take a few minutes depending
on the speed of your internet connection. So just be patient. [BLANK_AUDIO] Okay, so its finished downloading. [BLANK_AUDIO] So I'm just going to open up here, the package and you can see it'll start the
installer. Uh,and it'll guide you through all the
steps you need to install R 3.0.3. So, I'll click continue here, and this is just the description of what's going to
get installed. Click continue. The software license agreement is the [UNKNOWN] new general public license
version 2. So you should agree to the license, after
having read it of course. And then, you can just click install here,
and you might have to type in your
administrator password. So, just go ahead and do that. [SOUND] And it'll start installing the
files on your computer. [BLANK_AUDIO] [SOUND]. Now that's finished, I can hit close, and
then it'll be in my Applications folder. So I can just go to my Applications

it is. [BLANK_AUDIO] And there you have it. You have an R, installed R on your
