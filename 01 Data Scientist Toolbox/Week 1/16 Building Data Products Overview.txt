This is an overview of Building Data
Products, which is a sort of unique class that talks about,
what do you do with the data analysis or the R functions
that you've created; once you've built them, and you want to
share them with somebody else. So, we'll be talking about things like R
packages, how you build them, develop them and share
them. This is one of the best ways to get your
name out there as a data scientist. One of the main ways that people decide
about people to hire or who to go after is whether they built something that those people use
themselves. And so, R package is the best way to get
your name out in that way. We'll also talk about how to make
interactive graphics with things like rCharts and how to make interactive apps
with things like Slidify and Shiny. So, R packages you can think of it as sort for the engineers; it's, you're
going to build an R package to share code that you allow other people to use to improve their
analysis. So, we're going to teach you how to build
those; we're also going to teach you how to use rCharts; you can think of
this is like for marketing, build graphics, interactive
graphics like you see in the New York Times it'll allow you to share information that
can be interacted with by other people. And then, finally, Shiny, sort of for end
users, you can now use R itself to build web
applications that are quite intricate and involved and allow you
to just interact with data or interact with your analysis in
novel and unique ways. So, we'll talk about all of these things
in Building Data Products.
