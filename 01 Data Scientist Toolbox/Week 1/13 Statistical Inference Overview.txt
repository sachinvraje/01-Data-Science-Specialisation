Statistical Inference is going to be a
course that covers many of the foundational ideas that are involved with extracting generalizable information
from data. And so, the course will cover things like
basic probability, likelihoods common distributions,
confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, bootstrapping and power. These are the sort of fundamental ideas
that you often hear coming up when people are
reporting data analysis. So, for example, we'll talk about sort of
the way that you model mathematically coin
flips or proportions. We'll also talk a little bit about how you
model more continuous distributions, things like, with the
normal distribution which you've probably heard
about. As a way to measure sort of the
variability about a large number of different things including IQ
and height and things like that. And then we'll talk about things like
bootstrapping, where you actually use the data itself to sort of
create measures of variability that you can use to sort of
decide how generalizable are the answers that you get from
performing any particular analysis.
