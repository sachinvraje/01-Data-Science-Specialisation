2
00:00:15.088 --> 00:00:19.365
I am the game analytics lead at Miniclip.

3
00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:23.032
Prior to that,
I was the interim lead producer at

4
00:00:23.032 --> 00:00:27.421
Miniclip on the mobile division,
not the whole company.

5
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:29.467
>> I've been a stay at home mom for

6
00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:34.675
23 years of my biological triplets as
well as a series of foster children.

7
00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:37.605
But I'm now looking,
as my children are getting older,

8
00:00:37.605 --> 00:00:40.160
to perhaps getting back
into the workforce.

9
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.070
>> I'm a policy and
public affairs professional, and

10
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.080
over 10 years I've worked in policy
lobbying in Westminster in London.

11
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.160
But at the same time, I'm also a dance
artist and a budding choreographer.

12
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.380
Cuz it's very easy to sign up for a course
and to think, oh, this is a great thing,

13
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.090
it's really interesting and I would
like to learn a little bit about it.

14
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.070
But in fact it does require a bit of
preparation, listening to the lecture.

15
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.870
So in other words,
it needs some time to be put aside.

16
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.730
There is never enough time.

17
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.120
>> If it was an easy path or an easier
path, I think it wouldn't be so helpful.

18
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.795
>> It's a little overwhelming for
people of my generation, I think,

19
00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:28.116
because I didn't know how to set up my
microphone and I didn't necessarily know

20
00:01:28.116 --> 00:01:32.004
if I would be able to access all
the material and understand the videos.

[MUSIC]

22
00:01:34.878 --> 00:01:38.703
The fact that the lectures are in
video form is a very handy thing for

23
00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:43.007
someone like me who hasn't taken notes
in a really long time, because I can

24
00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:47.280
repeatedly pause it and rewind it and
go back over it again if I need to.

25
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.420
>> I take the lectures almost religiously.

26
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.120
I print the handouts.

27
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.640
I take handwritten notes.

28
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.010
And then I create my notes in a tidy way
that I keep on a different notebook.

29
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.780
>> Well, there's another side of
Coursera that I really appreciate, and

30
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.740
that is the peer review.

31
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.550
At first I was slightly skeptical, and

32
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.580
also a bit daunted because it's
an additional coursework and

33
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.380
actually it proved really helpful for
my own coursework

34
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.980
because it helped me understand what
are the sort of average standards?

35
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.938
What is the better way to
approach some of the tasks?

36
00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:27.310
And after awhile,

37
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.470
you just start to realize that there
is something as a common ground.

38
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.190
>> Assistants,
they are really knowledgeable.

39
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.790
They helped a lot of people who had some
difficulties because they didn't really

40
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.900
have the coding background.

41
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.460
To me at least I tend to start
having places where I go.

42
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.140
Rseek in the case of R helped a lot,
but if it was for

43
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.879
some other programming language,
I would probably go to Stack Overflow.

45
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:56.251
The things that I'm doing right now,
in my job,

46
00:02:56.251 --> 00:03:00.800
with what I learned is really nice and
was a great experience.

47
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.465
>> I also learned so much that I
felt clever again all of a sudden.

48
00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:06.930
[LAUGH] It was nice,

49
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.760
it activated parts of my brain
that I hadn't used in a long time.

50
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.230
>> Just in my household
there is three of us, and

51
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.320
all three of us have done at
least one Coursera course.

52
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.962
So it's really changed what
we do in our spare time.
