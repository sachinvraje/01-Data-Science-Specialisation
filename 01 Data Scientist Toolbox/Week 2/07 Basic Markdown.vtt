00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.610
This is the lecture on the basics of
markdown.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.210
So markdown is just a text file that's
formatted

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.780
in a very specific and simple way that
sites like

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.020
GitHub and also R and R Studio can
recognize and

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.080
can be used to do a lot of different
things.

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.710
You'll learn a lot more about markdown in

7
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.220
later courses, for example, the
reproducible research course.

8
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.150
But for the purposes of being able to deal
with GitHub, this is

9
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.950
also, I'm just going to give you really
the basics right now on markdown.

10
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.510
So the first thing that you want to be
able to

11
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.130
do and so it's just a text file that
you're editing.

12
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.527
And the extension for the text file is
.md.

13
00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:36.470
So you're going to create a file

14
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.630
that's for example readme.mda that's a
markdown file.

15
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.670
The first thing that you're going to do is
create headings.

16
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.180
So, for example, if you do the double
pound like

17
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.430
this, followed by some text it will create
a heading for a secondary heading.

18
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.190
So what will, what will happen is if you
upload a .md file, say for

19
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.320
example to GitHub, if you use two pound
signs and then followed by some text.

20
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.390
You'll end up seeing that the get
interpreted by GitHub as a heading.

21
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.630
So slightly larger, more bold text.

22
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.740
You can also create smaller headings by
using

23
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.870
a triple ha, or triple pound sign then.

24
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.190
And then typing this is a tertiary
heading.

25
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.590
And you'll see that GitHub interprets that
as a slightly smaller heading size.

26
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.510
The other thing that you can do with,
Markdown in addition to

27
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.930
typing just plain paragraphs is that you
can create lists very easily.

28
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.680
So, for example, if you type, is, this
star, and they you type

29
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.130
first item in the list, asterisk, second
item in the list, so forth.

30
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.370
You'll get an unordered list, in other
words a list

31
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.460
with dots, starting at the beginning,
nicely formatted by GitHub.

32
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.410
And so, those are the two basic things
that you need to know right now.

33
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.040
You can use headings, and you can use
lists to sort of organize your file.

34
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.086
And then you can just type plain
paragraphs as well.

35
00:01:57.086 --> 00:02:00.120
If you want to [UNKNOWN], know a lot more
about markdown, you can try

36
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.050
out this link right here or if once you've
installed Rstudio, you can actually

37
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.785
click the button, there's an MD button
right in the middle of the

38
00:02:07.785 --> 00:02:11.510
screen, that if you click on that, you'll
get a quick guide to markdown.

39
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.010
And so you will don't need R Markdown or

40
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.290
any of the more technical details, until
you get to

41
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.960
reproducible research, but this will be
useful, in terms

42
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.210
of putting sum into your first few
directories on GitHub.
