00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.230
This lecture is on installing Rtools.

2
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.840
This lecture is primarily useful for
people using Windows computers.

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.710
People that are using Mac or Linux don't
necessarily need this lecture.

4
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.990
So Rtools is a collection of tools that

5
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.300
are necessary for building R packages in
Windows.

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.840
We won't be doing that right away, but

7
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.030
later in developing data trials you will
be doing

8
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.140
that, so you need to be able to

9
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.500
install Rtools if you're going to complete
that class.

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.240
And so, Rtools is available for, download
at

11
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.540
this website up here, as I've listed it.

12
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.560
And so, what you can do is you can find a
version

13
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.496
of Rtools that is available that is the
latest version, and so you

14
00:00:34.496 --> 00:00:40.080
want to select the .exe download link, and
it corresponds to your version of

15
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.740
R, so you need to figure out what version
of R you have.

16
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.470
And then, download that version, if you
are not sure what version

17
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.450
of R you have, open and restart R and you
will see in

18
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.740
the very beginning there will be some text
listed out and one of

19
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.100
the things they list out in that text is
the version of R.

20
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.180
If you, have the most recent version of R,
you should select

21
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.080
the most recent Rtools download, it's at
the top of the chart.

22
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.730
And so, if you just installed R for this
course,

23
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.183
then you will also need the latest version
of Rtools.

24
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.490
Once the download completes, you'll just
open

25
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.700
the executable file to begin the
installation.

26
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.500
So basically unless you know what you're
doing, you should just

27
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.610
go with the default selection at each
steps of the installation.

28
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.450
There only two steps worth noting, so if

29
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.300
you already have Cygwin installed on your
machine,

30
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.250
you should just follow the instructions
given during

31
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.730
installation, and those instructions are
also at this URL.

32
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.490
And you should make sure that box is

33
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.850
checked to have the installer edit your
path.

34
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.810
And so you can see it very, very, if
you're very eagle eyed, in this below.

35
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.480
But basically make you sure check the box
to allow the installer to edit your path.

36
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.500
Once the Rtools installation completes,
you can open our studio, and

37
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.380
you install the dev tools package if you
don't already have it.

38
00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.500
So, if you type find.packages("devtools")
in the console,

39
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.730
you'll figure out whether you have it or
not.

40
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.970
And then to install it, you can just, as
in previous

41
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.050
lectures, just use
install.packages("devtools") like that,

42
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.939
and you'll have the devtools package.

43
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.068
After devtools is done installing you can
load it using library(devtools) and then

44
00:02:17.068 --> 00:02:22.490
type find_rtools(), like this as shown
below, and this should return a TRUE.

45
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.060
So you should see TRUE printed out on the
screen if

46
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.240
Rtools installation has worked properly
and you'll be ready to go.
