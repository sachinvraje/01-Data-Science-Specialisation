00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.380
This is a really brief introduction to
GitHub.

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.800
Git is a version control software that
allows you to control and

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.090
manage the revisions of projects that

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.900
you're working on locally on your
computer.

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.170
And as such, it's a very useful piece of
software on its own.

6
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.310
But GitHub is a more recent website that's
been developed.

7
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.570
It allows for you to collaborate on
projects together at a bigger scale.

8
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.770
And it's really where the power of Git
comes into play.

9
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.040
So GitHub is a web -based hosting service
for software development

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.570
that uses Git revis, revision control as
sort of a driving force.

11
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.700
And so what it allows you to do is
contribute to projects online And to have

12
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.630
your projects posted online so that other
people

13
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.325
can see them and contribute to them as
well.

14
00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:45.880
[SOUND] So, basically what it does is it
allows users to push and

15
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.790
pull their local repository, so things
that you got under bit, or bit,

16
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.170
version control in Git on your local
computer, it allows you to put

17
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.370
Push them and pull them to remote
repositories that are on the web.

18
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.820
It also provides users with a home page
that displays all of their repositories.

19
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.580
And the repositories that you have on
GitHub are backed up

20
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.690
on the server in case something happens to
your local ca, copies.

21
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.420
But the real key aspect of GitHub is the
social aspect and so the social aspect

22
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.100
allows users to follow one another and to
share projects

23
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.210
and to contribute to each other's projects
and so that's really the power of GitHub.

24
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.340
One of the things that we noticed bout
GitHub is that often

25
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.830
when you see somebody else's work You can
sort of learn what

26
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.570
they're working on, how their code works,
and it's a great way

27
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.720
to sort of identify people who would be
good to work with.

28
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.650
And we've also found that when we put

29
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.230
projects on the web, other people will
often

30
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.550
contribute, you know, for free, just
because they're

31
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.910
interested in how they can make the
software better.

32
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.470
So the first thing that you need to do is
go

33
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.440
set up a GitHub account now that you have
Git installed.

34
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.450
And so, you'll need to enter a username,

35
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.505
email, a password, and click sign up for
GitHub.

36
00:01:59.505 --> 00:02:02.710
[SOUND] An important note here is that you
should use

37
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.460
the same email address that you used when
you signed up

38
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.600
for Git in the previous lecture so that
it, you'll

39
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.740
be able to have the two pieces of software
work together.

40
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.530
On the next screen you're going to click
the

41
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.300
free plan and then click finish sign up.

42
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.312
And then you'll be signed up for a GitHub
account.

43
00:02:18.312 --> 00:02:22.829
[SOUND] This is a required component of
the class is having a GitHub account.

44
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.500
It's free, so it's not, it shouldn't be a
problem.

45
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.450
After signing up, you will find yourself
on this page,

46
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.360
which has several helpful resources for
learning about Git and GitHub.

47
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.260
I suggest that you read those tutorials,
as they're more in depth than

48
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.309
what we'll be able to cover in this class,
and they're incredibly useful.

49
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.810
If you click up here on your username in
the upper

50
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.840
right hand corner up there, you can see
your GitHub profile.

51
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.060
So, see all the projects that you
currently have,

52
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.850
which when you start your account, wont be
many.

53
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.950
Your profile will show all of your
activity from GitHub.

54
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.380
It'll also show other people who you are
and what you're working on.

55
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.940
So, you can fill out information

56
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.009
about what kind of projects you're
interested in.

57
00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:06.980
[INAUDIBLE] our plan is for this course is
to use this GitHub

58
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.960
Profile as the place that you can sort of
build a profile.

59
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.840
Which is a portfolio of the work that
you've

60
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.710
developed that shows off your skills as a
data scientist.

61
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.220
[SOUND] If you click edit your profile,
the right hand

62
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.270
portion of the screen you can add basic
information about yourself.

63
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.000
It's totally optional, so you don't have
to do that at all.

64
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.540
But if you're doing good work, so for

65
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.300
example, if in the course of this class
you

66
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.100
create interesting data science products
and ideas, you

67
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.718
want to be able to take credit for that.

68
00:03:36.718 --> 00:03:39.942
In the next lecture, we'll talk you
through how you actually

69
00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:43.240
create a repository, a repo, and put it up
on GitHub.

70
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.440
In the meantime, definitely explore the
documentation on the

71
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.320
GitHub site because it gives you lots of
different information.

72
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.970
That will help you when you're doing

73
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.890
virtual control ad when you're working
with GitHub.
