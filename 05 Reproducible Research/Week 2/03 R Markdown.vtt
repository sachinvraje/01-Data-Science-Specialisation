00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.580
This lecture's going to be about R
markdown.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.000
It's going to be a very short and just
description of what this is, because I

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.450
talk about it in a little bit more detail
when I talk about reproducible research.

4
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.840
So the basic idea behind R markdown is
that you want to have R code

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.540
integrated with a simple language that can
be used to kind of create documents.

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.590
And so the coupling is going to be the R
language with the markdown language.

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.600
So, first of all, what is markdown?

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.280
So markdown is a very simple kind of
markup language,

9
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.140
kind of play, a play on the word markup
language.

10
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.420
And the idea is that the, the mark,
markdown is

11
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.440
designed to help you focus on actually
writing things, right.

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.895
So when you think about it, if you're
experienced with languages like HTML or La

13
00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:47.445
Tec, or, or some of these other, or XML,
or some of these other things.

14
00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:48.700
you know, one of the things that you
notice

15
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.590
that you spend a lot of time thinking
about

16
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.600
the formatting, and, and thinking about
everything else

17
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.670
except the actual content that you're
trying to produce.

18
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.520
And so the basic philosophy behind
markdown is say, is to

19
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.070
create a language that allows writers to,
to do writing basically.

20
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.640
Right?

21
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.470
And so if you look at markdown it looks
very different from other

22
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.290
types of, of kind of markup languages like
XML or HTML or LATEC.

23
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.640
And so there are just very simple,

24
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.250
very minimal, kind of intuitive formatting
elements things

25
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.535
like boldface and, and and sections and
lists.

26
00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:24.130
And so be kinds of things that you would
typically need in

27
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.300
a basic document but not the very fancy
things that you might have.

28
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.260
But one of advantages of markdown is that

29
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.000
it, you can insert kind of arbitrary HTML
elements.

30
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.930
So if you are familiar with HTML and you
want something that's specific or

31
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.020
particular, and there isn't a basic
markdown

32
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.790
formatting element for it, you can just

33
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.071
put some HTML in, in the worst-case
scenario.

34
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:48.126
So one of the nice things about markdown
is, it's easily converted into HTML.

35
00:01:48.126 --> 00:01:51.960
There are tool chains out there that'll
take markdown, and in fact

36
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.666
convert it into many different formats,
HTML just being one of them.

37
00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:58.613
So you can let a lot of information at the

38
00:01:58.613 --> 00:02:00.914
website of, of John Gruber, where he has a
lot

39
00:02:00.914 --> 00:02:04.041
of documentation for markdown, and a
little bit of background

40
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:07.540
on kind of how, how this, how this project
evolved.

41
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.280
So, that was markdown.
What is R markdown?

42
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.800
So R markdown is basically the coupling of
R code in a markdown document.

43
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.690
So, the idea is that if you want to embed
R

44
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.780
code, in a document that's written in
markdown, you use R markdown.

45
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.950
And the, the basic idea is that this, it's
going to look a

46
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.310
lot like a standard R mark, I'm sorry, a
standard markdown document.

47
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.570
But there's

48
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.200
going to be R code sprinkled in, in, in
what are called code chunks.

49
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.635
And the code chunks'll be denoted by a
special formatting

50
00:02:38.635 --> 00:02:40.770
tags, which I'll show you in a little, in
a minute.

51
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.630
So when you integrate R code with markdown
that's an

52
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.860
R markdown document, typically has the r m
d extension.

53
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.310
And so the nice thing about using R
markdown is it

54
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.060
allows you to insert essentially live R
code into a markdown document.

55
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.920
So when you process the markdown document

56
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.990
to create your HTML or your PDF ultimate
you know, format, um,you

57
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.580
can evaluate the r code in as part of the
processing for markdown.

58
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.053
And so, so you know that the code in the
document if you're trying to demonstrate

59
00:03:13.053 --> 00:03:17.160
a tool, or you're trying, you know maybe
show some data or whatever it would be.

60
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.540
You know, that the code works in the
document because in

61
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.500
order for a document to be produced in the
first place the

62
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.300
code had to be executed and evaluated and
run.

63
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.600
And so everything in the document, any
code that

64
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.140
you see in a document, you know will work.

65
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.990
Because it had to, it had to work to
create the document.

66
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.810
So that's one nice thing about being able
to embed live R code in a document

67
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.540
is that you can ensure a, a, some, a
certain level of validity of the R code.

68
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.770
So the basic idea is the, you know, you
evaluate R code it,

69
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.680
the, the results of the R code is, is
inserted into the markdown document.

70
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.810
And mark, R markdown is a core

71
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.570
tool in what's known as literate
statistical programming.

72
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.890
And we'll talk about that a little,

73
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.050
much more when we talk about reproducible
research.

74
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.030
But for now, it's important just to think
of R

75
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.899
markdown as a way to put R code in a
document.

76
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.960
So you can evaluate R markdown documents
using the knitr package in R.

77
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.865
So the knitr has a, knitr essentially
reads an R markdown file,

78
00:04:14.865 --> 00:04:17.100
evaluates all the R code in it, it kind of
sticks in

79
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.560
the results of the R code, and then writes
out a Markdown file.

80
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.140
Now, that Markdown file can be converted
into HTML using the markdown package in R.

81
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.270
And so there's a bit, so there's a kind of
extra step of the pipeline here.

82
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.810
If you were just going to write markdown
you could just

83
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.340
convert that to HTML right away, but if
you're going to

84
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.470
write R markdown, then you need to use
something like

85
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.860
knitr, to kind of evaluate the R code,
create the markdown document,

86
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.620
and then, bring it to an HTML file.

87
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.830
So the knitr package and the mark down
package are, are important for this.

88
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.620
Any basic text editor can be used to

89
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.890
create a markdown document, or R markdown
document.

90
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.200
That's one of the nice features of this
type of markup

91
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.210
language is that you don't need any fancy
editors to visualize what

92
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.670
you're trying write, you can just use any
old text editor

93
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.970
and it will be fine; you don't need any
special editing tools.

94
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.670
So the, the basic workflow that you're
going to use if you

95
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.660
write in R markdown is, R, you write in
an, you kind,

96
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.340
your basic, your core document is an R
markdown file, so

97
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.190
it has markdown formatting elements and it
has R code in it.

98
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.880
Then you convert that into a markdown file
using the knitr package,

99
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.330
and then you take that markdown file,
which is essentially an intermediate file

100
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.030
that you're, you're not going to edit this
file, and you would take

101
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.940
that markdown file, and you convert it to
HTML using the markdown package.

102
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.740
And then HTML is kind of what you would
view in your browser or other viewer.

103
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.570
So the, the, now, the key elements of all
this is that you don't, you never edit the

104
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.490
intermediate or final products, so you
never edit the

105
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.030
markdown file and you never edit the HTML
file.

106
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.510
The only file that you're ever going to
edit is the R markdown

107
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.660
file which has the kind of original R code
and original markdown in it.

108
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.950
The whole workflow is very easily managed,
if you're using something like R Studio.

109
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.930
R Studio has knitr and markdown integrated
into it and furthermore

110
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.170
even has a little web browser built in so
you can actually

111
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.200
view the final product, if you're using R
Studio, and I'll

112
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.150
show a little demonstration of how to do
that in R Studio.

113
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.800
and, and just as one very quick example,
the slides that

114
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.340
you're looking at right now they were
written in R markdown.

115
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.170
Of course, there's no R code in here, so
it's, it's more or less just

116
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.150
plain markdown, but I built these slides

117
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.020
using the slidify package which calls
knitr and

118
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.170
the markdown packages, to convert them
into HTML.

119
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.740
So you can, there's a lot of flexibility
when

120
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.090
you're using a format formatting language
like R markdown

121
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.790
or just markdown and you can, because you
can

122
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.470
convert them to a lot of different other
presentation styles.
