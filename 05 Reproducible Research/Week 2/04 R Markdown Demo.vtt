00:00:02.877 --> 00:00:07.110
This is just going to be a quick demo
on how to use R Markdown in RStudio.

2
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.500
You can see I've got RStudio open here and
so I'm just going to start by opening up

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.045
a new file and
writing a little bit of R Markdown.

4
00:00:14.045 --> 00:00:19.180
Okay so you can go up to the menu here and
there are a couple of options here,

5
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.780
but we're going to choose
an R Markdown file.

6
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.670
And the first thing you'll
see is this menu here.

7
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.810
They'll ask you, kind of, what your
default output format is going to be.

8
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.660
So it will, start at, it will have
the HTML option preselected and

9
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.810
that's usually where you're, what you're
going to what do you going to go with.

10
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.530
If you choose PDF or Microsoft Word,
you're going to have to

11
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.660
install other outside tools in
order to process those formats.

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.280
So I'm just going to create a title here.

13
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.170
I'll call it, My First Markdown Document.

14
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.190
You don't have to put the author but
okay I will.

15
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.720
And then you can just hit OK.

16
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.540
So now you've got a markdown document here
in RStudio and let me just close this

17
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.750
window here to, and you can see that
it pre-populates the document with

18
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.760
a little bit of text so the first
thing we'll do which is simple enough,

19
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.150
is I'll just hit the knit,
knit HTML button to see what happens.

20
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.540
You can see that it creates this,
HTML document in its own viewer here.

21
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.350
I move it over here.

22
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.390
You can see that it,
the text is rendered in HTML.

23
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.850
There's code here in the gray boxes.

24
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.880
So here your summarizing the cars
data set which comes with R.

25
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.620
It gives you the output for that code and
since the, there was a plot made,

26
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.110
you can put the, the plot will
just appear here at the bottom.

27
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.210
So you get this nice HTML document
that's generated from your,

28
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.410
your code that's written in this,
in this markdown document here.

29
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.370
Now this is obviously not going to be,
the ki,

30
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.300
the, the, the text that we want to present
so the first thing you'll probably need to

31
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.910
do is to kind of delete what's
automatically populated here from de-,

32
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.430
by default.

33
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.430
So you can keep the stuff
up here in the top,

34
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.484
in the preamble but
we'll delete everything else after that.

35
00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:02.450
[SOUND] Okay, so now that we've gotten
all this boilerplate text out of

36
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.082
the way we can start
creating our document.

37
00:02:06.082 --> 00:02:08.249
But before we do that,
we probably want to save it first just so

38
00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:10.510
we can,
that we don't accidentally lose anything.

39
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.920
So let's click the Save button and

40
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.052
I'll just save it as you
know,Markdowm Demo rnd.

41
00:02:19.052 --> 00:02:21.287
[SOUND] Okay.

42
00:02:21.287 --> 00:02:23.520
So the document's saved and
I can start writing my text.

43
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.110
So I'll be able to say you know,
this is my first markdown document.

44
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.430
And so the first thing you often want to
do in an analysis probably load and

45
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.560
summarize data do a little
exploratory analysis.

46
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.470
So, let's load data.

47
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.650
And you want to open a code
block with the back ticks.

48
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.500
It's going to be an r code block.

49
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.990
And I'm just going to load the air
quality data set that, that comes with r.

50
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.974
So, you can load the data sets package.

51
00:02:51.974 --> 00:02:53.670
And then load the air quality data set.

52
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.140
And just, I'm going to
summarize it just very simply.

53
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.910
Then we close the code block like that.

54
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.770
So that's our first, r code block,

55
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.230
and and let's see what this
looks like when we knit it.

56
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.690
So I can click the Knit button here.

57
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.580
And you'll see, first of all,

58
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.629
that it saves the document and
then it, it runs [INAUDIBLE].

59
00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.590
You can see I've got my title,
I've got my text here.

60
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.010
Got my codeblock over here, and

61
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.030
then this is the summary of the code,
of the, of the dataset.

62
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.780
You can see that for
each column of the data,

63
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.100
of the dataframe,
it produces a little five number summary.

64
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.830
Okay?

65
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.329
So, so that's great, and we can close
this here, and, continue working.

66
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.142
So maybe let's do a little
bit of exploratory analysis.

67
00:03:38.142 --> 00:03:41.590
Maybe want to visualize some of
the data so we can make a pairs plot or

68
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.510
what's sometimes called a scatter,
a scatter plot matrix.

69
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.960
So, now here's a pairs plot of the data.

70
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.740
again, we open the code block
with the three back takes.

71
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.730
I can very simply just do pairs it, on
the air quality, and then we can run that.

72
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.690
So notice I did have to do
anything special to create a plot.

73
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.680
I just, just call the plotting code and
then I can knit the document.

74
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.580
You can see now I've got the pairs
plot down here at the bottom and it

75
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.480
shows the kind of paralyzed scatter plots
of all the variables in the data set.

76
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.065
And then lastly we might want to fit
some sort of progression model just to

77
00:04:19.065 --> 00:04:20.320
kind of see if we can predict for

78
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.160
example ozone from let's say solar
radiation wind and temperature.

79
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.270
So let's put that in document two.

80
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.820
So here's, whoops excuse me.

81
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.531
[SOUND] of ozone.

82
00:04:36.531 --> 00:04:43.899
[SOUND] So,
we can open the codeblock one more time.

83
00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:48.814
And I'll call this,
I'll say A Linear Model of

84
00:04:48.814 --> 00:04:54.090
Ozone on Solar Radiation wind,
the temperature.

85
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.370
The data comes from this
air quality data frame.

86
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.290
And then we can summarize the fit
to see what the regression

87
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.150
coefficients look like.

88
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.420
So, I can [INAUDIBLE] the doc,
the document one more time.

89
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.350
see, I've got the summary of the data
up here, I've got the paralyzed

90
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.840
scatter plots down here, and then finally
I've got my code for the linear model.

91
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.190
I can summarize it down, and

92
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.960
it summarizes the, the linear
model fit down here at the bottom.

93
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.980
You can see that these,

94
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.750
all these predictors are all highly
associated with the outcome ozone.

95
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.400
So the model is has some
predictive value there.

96
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.356
So I should mention, in, in the lecture
on the markdown, there are other

97
00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:41.212
things you can do for example, you can
create an unordered list by just, using

98
00:05:41.212 --> 00:05:47.240
either asterisk or any sort of or any to
indicate kind of the bullets of the list.

99
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.675
So, you know, here's item one.

100
00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:54.669
[SOUND] Item two.

101
00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.440
You can create an ordered list.

102
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.706
[SOUND] Just by using numbers excuse me.

103
00:06:02.706 --> 00:06:07.931
[SOUND] And so our markdown is
really useful for very quickly and

104
00:06:07.931 --> 00:06:14.180
very simply creating documents, and
with the addition of the r code,

105
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.775
you can nest your written text
with code and output that kind of

106
00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:26.267
that runs your date analysis so you can
have everything in a single document here.

107
00:06:26.267 --> 00:06:29.972
So all this is really easy to do in
R Studio so I encourage you to open up

108
00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:34.522
RStudio, set, create your first R
markdown doc, document, a, a, and

109
00:06:34.522 --> 00:06:38.560
put a little text, put a little code
in and take a look at how it works.
