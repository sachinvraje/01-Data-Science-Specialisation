00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.300
So what is knitr?

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.820
So knitr is this tool that I'm going to

3
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.130
talk about that can help you make these
reproducible documents.

4
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.210
Knitr is an R package.

5
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.420
It's written by Yihui Xie who, while he
was a grad student at Iowa State.

6
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.330
It's available on CRAN.

7
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.630
If you happen to use the package R Studio
it's actually built

8
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.130
into R Studio, and so it's,

9
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.810
it's integrated into the graphical user
interface.

10
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.860
And so, you don't even have to obtain it
separately if you're using R-Studio.

11
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.290
So, it supports for the documentation
language.

12
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.150
It supports, something called RMarkdown.

13
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.640
It also supports, LaTeX and HTML.

14
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.700
So these are three languages, that are
commonly used.

15
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.760
And then, it can export to PDF and HTML
and and you can

16
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.280
also export to other formats if using,
using other external tools like Pandoc.

17
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.100
It's built right into RStudio for your
convenience, as I just mentioned.

18
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.050
So, what do you need to use knitr?
You need a recent version

19
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.040
of R.
You need a text editor.

20
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.770
You can use the one that comes with
RStudio if you

21
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.540
happen to be using that, otherwise any old
text editor will do.

22
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.484
You need some support packages that are
available from CRAN.

23
00:01:01.484 --> 00:01:05.214
These will be automatically downloaded if
you use the install dot packages function.

24
00:01:05.214 --> 00:01:08.450
You need some knowledge of one of the
three documentation languages.

25
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.970
So, you need, need to know Markdown, LaTeX
or HTML.

26
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.240
And I will talk about Markdown here

27
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.260
since it's a fairly simple language to
understand.

28
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.750
So, what is Markdown?

29
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.630
Well, it's a simplified version of common
markup languages.

30
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.080
So LaTeX and HTML could be thought of as
markup languages,

31
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.610
where you take regular text and you kind
of add things

32
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.060
to it, add tags and other types of
annotation to kind

33
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.830
of tell, to indicate what you want to do
with the text.

34
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.090
One problem with markup languages is that
they can

35
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.130
be kind of like with they can be very

36
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.230
difficult to read cause all this kind of
tags

37
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.890
and things that, that, that can, can, that
can obscure

38
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.450
the actual text.

39
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.960
So the purpose of Markdown is just kind of

40
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.940
simplify all that, make it easy to read
just

41
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.000
the text and only have a few kind of

42
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.640
formatting elements that you need to enter
into the document.

43
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.890
There's no special editor required, just a
standard text

44
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.810
editor, Notepad, you know, whatever you
want to use.

45
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.680
There are simple, intuitive formatting
elements and you can

46
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.650
get all of the documentation at this
website here.

47
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.360
So, what is knitr good for in terms of
creating reproducible documents?

48
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.730
Well, personally, I think it's good for
things like manuals.

49
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.300
If you want to instruct someone on how to
use a piece of software.

50
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.680
Short or medium length technical documents

51
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.040
so you're explaining some technical
concept.

52
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.080
tutorials, if you want to, again, this is
like a

53
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.660
manual, but maybe more extended, a
tutorial on some topic.

54
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.320
reports, they're especially useful for
reports.

55
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.700
If you have to, for example, every week

56
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.780
generate a report on some database or some
dataset.

57
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.460
If you're running a study and you

58
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.220
have subjects that are constantly being
enrolled

59
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.760
in the study and then maybe every week you
generate a report on, it, it

60
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.280
has summary statistics about about the
study

61
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.440
that these kinds of live documents are

62
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.660
very useful because you can recalculate
all

63
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.010
the summary statistics as you generate the
document.

64
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.480
You don't have to do it by hand and then
stick it into a report separately.

65
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.270
And then also for data preprocessing.

66
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.220
So, often it's useful if you're going to
preprocess

67
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.076
a dataset to create a clean dataset, to
create a knitr type document where, that

68
00:03:04.076 --> 00:03:07.620
documents all of the things that you do to
the dataset to make it clean.

69
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.880
Maybe you remove some outliers, maybe you
fill in some

70
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.650
missing data, maybe you transform a
variable here and there.

71
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.044
All of that can be documented, in this
kind of knitr's file, you know, where

72
00:03:17.044 --> 00:03:20.420
you simultaneously say what you did and
then you actually do it in the code.

73
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.050
What is knitr not good for?

74
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.240
Well in, by, in my opinion, it's not very
good for very long research articles,

75
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.240
so if you're writing, writing a very
complex,

76
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.285
very involved analysis it, like I said
before,

77
00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:35.940
because everything is stored in a single
document,

78
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.120
it can get a little bit confusing to

79
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.329
kind of edit this document if there's a
lot of code and a lot of text.

80
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.145
If you have, if have very complex or
time-consuming computations

81
00:03:45.145 --> 00:03:48.220
then knitr is often not a good format
because you have

82
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.760
to recompile this document every time you
want to look at it.

83
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.780
And so if your computations are very slow

84
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.310
this will just kind of make everything
slow.

85
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.102
And furthermore if you have a document, if
you

86
00:03:57.102 --> 00:03:59.700
want to create a document that requires
very precise formatting.

87
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.190
So if you have a special layout and the
pictures have to

88
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.792
go here and the text has to go here or
something like that.

89
00:04:04.792 --> 00:04:07.680
Knitr is, again, not a super great tool
for

90
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.040
that because the formatting tends to be
very ad hoc.
