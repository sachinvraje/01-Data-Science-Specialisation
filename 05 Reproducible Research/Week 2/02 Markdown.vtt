2
00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:05.973
Markdown is a really useful language for

3
00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:09.141
creating documents without having to deal
with

4
00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:10.869
a lot of the overhead and kind

5
00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:14.817
of complications of using standard markup
languages.

6
00:00:14.817 --> 00:00:16.705
The idea behind Markdown is that it's

7
00:00:16.705 --> 00:00:20.270
a, you know, it's a simplified markup
language.

8
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.740
And it really, the, the goal is to, to
allow you to focus on just writing

9
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.460
your content and not have to worry about

10
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.650
things like tags or other things like
that.

11
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.420
And so Markdown, you'll notice, is very
simple.

12
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.450
And we use it a lot here.

13
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.170
All of the slides for the course are
written in Markdown And a nice thing

14
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.660
about Markdown is that it's very easy to

15
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.170
integrate it with Rcode, and other
programming languages.

16
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.790
So, in this lecture I'm just going to talk
about the very basics of Markdown.

17
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.360
But of course it, beyond the basics
actually there's not a whole lot.

18
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.990
So that's what makes Markdown so, so nice.

19
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.488
And then once I'll just talk a little bit
about kind of the basic aspects and give,

20
00:00:53.488 --> 00:00:57.020
give you a few pointers on kind of where
you can go to learn about more.

21
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.520
So,

22
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.470
so just to start off with, Markdown is

23
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.640
a text to HTML conversion tool for web
writers.

24
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.910
Markdown allows you to write easy, using
an easy to use, read,

25
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.410
easy to write, plain text format and then
convert to structurally valid XHTML.

26
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.540
So the idea is that, so the, John Gruber,
the creator of Markdown, wanted people

27
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.290
to be able to focus on writing their
content, and not other kind of aspects.

28
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.960
And so, the basic syntax for Markdown is
fairly simple.

29
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.520
For, so,

30
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.790
you can you can format text, for example
with italics

31
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.910
using the asterisks here and then the text
will be italicized.

32
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.165
You can do things like create bold face
with the,

33
00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:41.010
with the double asterisk and the text will
appear bold.

34
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.060
You can create headings.

35
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.620
There are different sizes, so if you're
familiar with

36
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.690
HTML you can think of this as H1, H2, H3.

37
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.740
So the two hashes, this is a secondary
heading.

38
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.252
The three hashes is a tertiary heading.

39
00:01:53.252 --> 00:01:55.372
And then a single hash, which I didn't put
here

40
00:01:55.372 --> 00:01:58.130
is a, is like a main heading, a primary
heading.

41
00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.930
And so you can see that there are
different sizes here.

42
00:02:02.304 --> 00:02:05.048
You can create very simple unordered lists
by putting

43
00:02:05.048 --> 00:02:08.280
a little indicator there, like a hyphen or
an asterisk.

44
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.196
It doesn't really matter what the the
character is that you

45
00:02:11.196 --> 00:02:14.550
use there as long as it's kind of
consistent across the list.

46
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.060
So you can create an unordered list like
this by

47
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.200
just just starting it right away, there's
no other formatting element.

48
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.750
You can create an ordered list here by
just doing one, two, and three.

49
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.400
And the, and, and the truth is actually,

50
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.270
although it's a little, it's not
immediately clear here

51
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.640
the numbering doesn't have to actually be
in order.

52
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.610
As long as you use a number as the kind of
character that, kind

53
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.430
of, that indents the line it will cr-, the
Markdown will create an ordered list.

54
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.470
And so, if you decide that oh, you know,
you want to stick something in

55
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.930
between one and two, you don't have to
renumber every element on the list.

56
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.990
You can just stick another item there
under the first item.

57
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.040
And it could be another one, or it could
be four, it could be

58
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.360
any number, the numbers don't have to be
in order, but when you process

59
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.730
the document Markdown will automatically
order the list in the right way.

60
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.140
You can of course put links into a
document,

61
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.760
this is very important if you're creating
web documents.

62
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.390
And there are two ways to create links.

63
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.070
The first way I've got here puts the text
in square

64
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.480
brackets, and then immediately following
that puts the URL in parenthesis.

65
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.778
So, here I can see Johns Hopkins Bloomberg
School of Public Health.

66
00:03:17.778 --> 00:03:19.920
And and the URL is right next to it, and

67
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.620
then Download R with the R website right
next to that.

68
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.660
And so and then it'll be formatted in an
HTML

69
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.820
document in the usual way.

70
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.479
The text will be highlighted, and
underlined.

71
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.040
The other way to to create links in a
Markdown

72
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.720
document is to put the, again, the text in
square brackets.

73
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.920
And then, and right next to it in square
brackets put

74
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.800
a number which is going to be like an
identifier for that link.

75
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.830
And then later on, perhaps at the bottom
of the document you

76
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.940
can put the actual URL for for the length
that you meant.

77
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.720
So, number one here is for R

78
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.190
bloggers and at the bottom of the document
I might

79
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.800
put a number one and then the R bloggers
URL.

80
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.580
And then the second link here is for
Simply Statistics,

81
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.850
so for number two I put the Simply
Statistics URL.

82
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.570
The basic idea with this type of linking
is that it makes

83
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.210
the text in your document a little bit
cleaner and easier to read.

84
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.890
Especially if you have very long URL's.

85
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.540
And you, and you don't necessarily want to
put all these really

86
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.080
long URL's in the document so it makes it
hard to read.

87
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.050
This makes it a little bit easier to read,
while your

88
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.080
editing the document and puts all the
links down at the bottom.

89
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.580
Lastly new lines can be created in the
text document by

90
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.020
just putting a double space at the end of
a line.

91
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.620
So I just do first line, second line like

92
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.230
this with just, with no space after the
first line.

93
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.558
All the lines will run together like that.

94
00:04:33.558 --> 00:04:36.654
But if I put two spaces after the first
line then

95
00:04:36.654 --> 00:04:39.976
you'll get a kind of a new line put in
between.

96
00:04:39.976 --> 00:04:42.322
So just the, that's going to be just an
easy gotcha, that

97
00:04:42.322 --> 00:04:46.072
can be the people who newly come into
Markdown will often discover.

98
00:04:46.072 --> 00:04:47.458
So that's just a really,

99
00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:49.428
really quick overview of Markdown.

100
00:04:49.428 --> 00:04:50.988
Here's some basic resources of the

101
00:04:50.988 --> 00:04:53.380
official Markdown documentation on, on
Jon-,

102
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.390
John Grubers website, is very easy to
read, it's very, it's relatively short.

103
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.984
You'll be able to learn it within minutes.

104
00:04:58.984 --> 00:05:03.162
You already know most of it just by
readin-, by looking at this lecture.

105
00:05:03.162 --> 00:05:04.752
And then, Github has its own kind of

106
00:05:04.752 --> 00:05:07.290
Markdown flavor, with a few kind of
enhancements.

107
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.044
So if you're going to be using Github and
documenting things in

108
00:05:10.044 --> 00:05:13.270
Github it might be useful to check out
their Markdown guide.
