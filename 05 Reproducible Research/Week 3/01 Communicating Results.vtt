00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.940
This lecture is not so much about
reproducible research, per se.

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.460
But it's more about how you can
communicate your results, in a way

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.480
that people can understand them, and can
check your results, if they need to.

4
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.190
So particularly, when you're doing a large
data

5
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.860
analysis, or, you know, a complex kind of
project.

6
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.560
And you do your work in a reproducible
manner.

7
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.950
You're going to generate a lot of content
and a lot of files and a lot of

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.200
output and a lot of data.
And those all cannot be presented at once.

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.810
And so when you present your, your kind of
findings to another person you're going to

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.805
have, there's going to, there's a kind of

11
00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:42.280
hierarchy of information that you're
going to want to present.

12
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.330
Ranging from kind of least specific to
most specific.

13
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.110
So the bottom line is that, you know, most
people are, these days are very busy.

14
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.510
People like managers and

15
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.250
organization leaders are going to be very
busy.

16
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.150
And so they are going to have to kind of
accept content that you present.

17
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.850
At a, at a kind of a, at a, at a, at a, in
a kind of hierarchical matter.

18
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.810
So the idea is that, you know, many times,
when you, when you present a

19
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.540
data analysis, it will be in an oral form
like a presentation or in a meeting.

20
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.510
But often the kind of early results or
intermediate

21
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.270
results are, are presented via, via a
medium like email.

22
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.800
And it's useful to break

23
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.720
down the results of an analysis into

24
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.730
kind of different levels of specificity or
granularity.

25
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.570
And so here's a link to just some general
advice

26
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.660
on kind of how to get email responses from
busy people.

27
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.330
But the basic idea is that you don't want

28
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.140
to kind of blast a ton of information to
someone

29
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.370
in one go, because it'll be overwhelming,
and people will

30
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.060
be less likely to read what you have to
say.

31
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.990
So if you think about you know, what a
typical research

32
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.350
paper might look like, you know, there's
a, it's

33
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.500
a hierarchy of information built into a
research paper.

34
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.200
So typically the first level is going to
be the title.

35
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.880
Which is descriptive of what the paper's

36
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.440
about, hopefully it's interesting, it
tells you

37
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.520
a little bit about what's going on, but
there's really no detail in a title.

38
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.120
Just the kind of the topic that's covered.

39
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.780
The next will be the abstract, which would
be, usually

40
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.780
be a couple hundred words, about what the
paper's about.

41
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.720
You know, what motivated the problem

42
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.320
what they did to solve the problem.

43
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.130
What the, kind of the bottom line results
were.

44
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.120
So that's only going to be in the
abstract.

45
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.760
Then of course you have the paper itself.

46
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.790
You know, the body of the paper will show
you, will have the, you know, the methods.

47
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.400
And more details about what you really
did.

48
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.470
There will be the more detailed results
any sensitivity analyses you

49
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.070
know, things can, things like that will be
in the paper.

50
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.860
And a much longer discussion of the
implications of the results.

51
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.550
But of course,

52
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.780
even the written paper these days, for

53
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.010
a complex data analysis, doesn't specify,
really, all

54
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.370
the details that need to be used to need,
that are needed to reproduce the findings.

55
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.540
So then you typically might have some
supplementary de, materials which

56
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.030
have a lot more of the details about what
was done.

57
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.580
And, and then if you really, really
want to

58
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.810
kind of do what was done to a level of

59
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.070
precision that is kind of useful, you
probably need

60
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.625
to get the code, the data and all the

61
00:02:57.625 --> 00:02:59.070
gory details of kind of what happened.

62
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.290
So that's kind of like the, the range of
things that you

63
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.850
might be able to present from least
specific to most specific, so

64
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.200
not everyone, of course, is going to be
writing a research paper,

65
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.750
but there is an analog to kind of most
presentations of data analysis.

66
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.750
And so, if you're going to be you know,
mailing results to a person.

67
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.840
Either a colleague, or a manager.

68
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.040
then, you know, the, the first line of
information is the

69
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.745
subject of the email, all right, so the
subject of the

70
00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:24.590
e-mail is kind of like the title.

71
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.700
And you want to have it, kind of concise,
you want to

72
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.960
be descriptive, and at a minimum, you want
to have one, all right?

73
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.100
So don't leave it, don't, don't send an
e-mail without a

74
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.145
subject, so it's not specific as to what
the e-mail is about.

75
00:03:36.145 --> 00:03:38.120
If you can summarize kind of what you've
done in one

76
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.700
sentence, the, then it may be useful put
that in the subject.

77
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.600
That way people reading the subject can
kind of get a sense

78
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.260
of what's happening and maybe even make a
decision based on that alone.

79
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.200
The next level of information of course is
the email body.

80
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.600
And you, you don't want to go, even though
there's no technical limit

81
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.760
on the size of the email body, you don't
want to go too crazy

82
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.770
with this, But you want to have, you know
provide a brief description of

83
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.220
the problem maybe if someone doesn't, you
know, if the person may not remember.

84
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.420
If they're working on many different
things at

85
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.090
once, they may not remember what the
problem

86
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.340
is, precisely what you're working on, so
give

87
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.020
them a little context, give them a little
description.

88
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.000
Recall, you know, if there was a meeting
previously.

89
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.325
You know, talk about what was

90
00:04:13.325 --> 00:04:16.160
proposed and, you know, and what you
actually did.

91
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.650
Summarize some of your findings and your
results and maybe, you know, for

92
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.380
a total for one to two paragraphs in this
whole, the email body.

93
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.430
If you need this, the person that you're
presenting the

94
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.820
information to to take some sort of action
based on these,

95
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.770
the results of this presentation, then you
should try to

96
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.830
suggest some options that and make them as
concrete as possible.

97
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.380
Alright.
So and

98
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.960
if there are questions that need to be
addressed,

99
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.530
if you want them to kind of comeback with

100
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.360
an answer, it's usually best to try to
make

101
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.070
them yes no questions or as simple as
possible.

102
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.400
After the email body, of course, you might
be able

103
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.310
to attach something that's quite a bit
longer, a PDF file

104
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.200
or another type of document, and so this
can be like

105
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.890
a report containing more detailed

106
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.320
analyses, figures, tables, things like
that.

107
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.720
You can, this can be derived from an R
markdown file.

108
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.100
You can use it, you know, something that
you create with knitr.

109
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.170
But of course, even in the report like
this where you may

110
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.630
be allowed, you know, a couple of pages
to, to present things,

111
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.000
you still want to stay concise, you don't
want to spit

112
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.670
out pages and pages of code and tables and
results.

113
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.030
We know that your code is available
because if you

114
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.530
use something like knitr then obviously,
you have to kind

115
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.230
of put the code in with the results, but
you

116
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.335
don't necessarily have to present it all
in the report.

117
00:05:31.335 --> 00:05:33.160
Your opportunity to do something like that
of course

118
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.150
will be, if, if you, if you have someone
who

119
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.640
really wants to look at what you put, what
you

120
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.740
did precisely, you can give em a link to
some

121
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.530
sort of repository, like GitHub, or a
project

122
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.920
website that would have all of the
details.

123
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.000
Or all your code files.

124
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.900
All your data sets.

125
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.990
All your, all that kind of, all the nitty
gritty like that.

126
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.650
All your, your software environment,
things like that.

127
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.576
And so.

128
00:05:52.576 --> 00:05:54.860
So that's kind of the level of, different
levels

129
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.790
of detail that you might want to present
to someone.

130
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.902
And so people who are truly interested in
everything

131
00:05:58.902 --> 00:06:00.774
that you did, you know, or really want to
know

132
00:06:00.774 --> 00:06:02.454
kind of the details, they might go to your

133
00:06:02.454 --> 00:06:05.046
GitHub repository and start pulling your
code and start looking

134
00:06:05.046 --> 00:06:07.880
at it and start looking at the detailed
results.

135
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.895
But someone who wants kind of top line

136
00:06:09.895 --> 00:06:12.760
or I should say, you know, top line
summaries.

137
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.260
You know, they'll, they'll read the email,
they'll

138
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.770
look at the subject, they'll read the
brief description.

139
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.718
And might flip through the report.

140
00:06:18.718 --> 00:06:21.290
And so different, the point is that
different people are going to

141
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.900
be interested in different levels of
details of, about what you've done.

142
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.350
So you want to be, and so you want to

143
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.050
present people with those different
levels, so that they might

144
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.030
be able to choose the level that they are
most interested in.

145
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.160
And so this is just kind of a generic
template for kind of how you

146
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.670
might present a an analysis or a data, or
a project that you've worked on.

147
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.580
Not every presentation will kind of need
all

148
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.500
these different levels but I think that, I

149
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.230
find this to be a useful breakdown of

150
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.590
the different types of presentations that
you can make.
