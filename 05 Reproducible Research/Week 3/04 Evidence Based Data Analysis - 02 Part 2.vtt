00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.950
So just to diagram out this re, what

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.380
kind of, the framework reproducible
research I think about.

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.160
Typically you have some published article
that you view

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.050
you know, in a journal, and that's all you
get.

5
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.940
You get everything that's in the article.

6
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.045
You probably have some exposure to what
their scientific question was, and these

7
00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:22.220
people went into into nature and it was
all, and then there's nothing, right?

8
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.670
And so, you have a, you know, you have a
author whose kind of

9
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.932
starting from here and went that way, and
then the reader kind of starts to

10
00:00:27.932 --> 00:00:29.900
move there and wants to go this way.

11
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.590
But for the most part, in most cases, the

12
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.100
reader can start with the article, and
then they're welcome

13
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.270
to go back to nature, and just, you know,

14
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.180
do it again, or replicate the study if
they want.

15
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.940
There's really not anything else that they
can

16
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.610
do, besides read the article and be
impressed.

17
00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:46.470
So that's the express train to nature.

18
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.880
So, but really, of course, there's all
this other stuff, you

19
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.880
know the data that I call the broad data
or measured data.

20
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.930
There's stuff that happens to that data,
that, so a specific analysis can be done.

21
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.620
There's all this code that is involved to
do that,

22
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.010
there's results, there's figures and
tables, and this and that.

23
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.445
So that all exist, but it's typically not
available, and so the basic idea

24
00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:09.740
of reproducible research is to say, okay
well lets all, lets just meet in the

25
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.550
middle over here, and say let's make the
stuff available to make the analytic

26
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.090
data available, maybe, maybe make some
code

27
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.570
available, some of the preprocessing if
it's important,

28
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.380
things like that.

29
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.500
So that's the kind of reproducibility

30
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.390
compromise short of replicating the whole
study.

31
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.930
So, so I want to get a little into what
problem this reproducibility solve.

32
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.910
And I think one of the things that we get,
from a reproducible study,

33
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.790
is we get transparency of course, we have
a better sense of what they've done.

34
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.820
We get data, the data that they use, so
that's available.

35
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.830
If there's methods involved

36
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.010
that are new, we get their methods.

37
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.380
And we have this more, a kind of increased
transfer of knowledge, because

38
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.600
now we know exactly what they did, not
what they meant to do.

39
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.820
I, I, might be what we do, we don't get
any

40
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.840
sort of sense of whether the analysis was,
was correctly done.

41
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.520
And I think the main reason's because
analysis can

42
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.650
be very, be reproducible and still be
wrong, and

43
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.080
there are many examples of this in the
literature

44
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.440
where something was totally wrong but yet
fully reproducible.

45
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.510
So just

46
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.740
because they don't, the people use the
wrong methods, so they, you

47
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.360
know, they kind of treated the data in the
wrong way and whatnot.

48
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.850
So, I think the fundamental question of,
can we

49
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.210
trust this analysis, is not really
addressed by reproducibility.

50
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.530
These things are all very important so I
think that's fine.

51
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.510
But we still have I think a little bit of
a problem over here, so and one question

52
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.840
you might legitimately ask is you know
does requiring,

53
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.230
if you required every study, every
analysis to be reproducible,

54
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.630
would that somehow deter people from doing
that analysis.

55
00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:40.060
And I, I fundamentally think the answer is
no.

56
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.630
So,

57
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.300
so some of the problems I have with
reproducibility

58
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.710
are, so the premise of reproducible
research is that,

59
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.910
you know, with all the data and all the

60
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.200
code available to people, people can check
each other.

61
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.870
You can kind of validate someone else's
analysis, and the whole

62
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.110
system would kind of be self correcting in
the long run.

63
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.700
Alright.

64
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.970
So one problem which I don't see here is

65
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.470
that the long run sometimes is too long
and then

66
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.380
in terms of the context of the problems
that

67
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.700
you're dealing with I think
reproducibility addresses what I call

68
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.000
most, the kind of downstream aspects of
scientific dissemination.

69
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.930
Now, I'll be more specific about what I
mean by that.

70
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.910
Meaning that it kind of only happens post
publication [INAUDIBLE].

71
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.512
And another key thing which is important
in my area, maybe.

72
00:03:22.512 --> 00:03:24.948
I mean, particularly in my area, is that,
[COUGH]

73
00:03:24.948 --> 00:03:27.790
the ideas of reproducibility kind of
assume that everyone

74
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.052
plays by the same rules, and everyone
wants to

75
00:03:30.052 --> 00:03:33.110
achieve the same goals, which is
definitely not true.
