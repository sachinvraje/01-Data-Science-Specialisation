1
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.100
So the, my only thinking is that we should

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.120
just take this principle and apply it
everywhere, right?

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.160
As much as possible to create analytic
pipelines from evidence-based components.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.070
So and to standardize it.

5
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.640
And so jeff has a, another contribution to
this.

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.950
Is, he calls this the deterministic
statistical machine.

7
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.150
The idea that you have a algorithm or
pipeline that produces

8
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.550
a deterministic result given a set of data
and a minimal,

9
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.284
minimal set of inputs.

10
00:00:28.284 --> 00:00:31.710
And so once this evidence based pipeline

11
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.820
is established, you don't mess with it,
alright?

12
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.460
So I call this, kind of, transparent box
analysis, right?

13
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.028
So it's a box, so you don't mess with

14
00:00:38.028 --> 00:00:40.478
it, it's like Al Gore's lock box, but it's
transparent

15
00:00:40.478 --> 00:00:43.271
because you know exactly what's happening
in there, alright, so

16
00:00:43.271 --> 00:00:45.747
it's not a black box, you can see what's
happening.

17
00:00:45.747 --> 00:00:47.408
But the point is, you don't mess with it.

18
00:00:47.408 --> 00:00:48.829
So, one of the goals of this is

19
00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.426
to reduce the so-called researcher degrees
of freedom,

20
00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.876
where people can tinker with every single
tuning parameter

21
00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:56.869
in the whole pipeline, which is, kind of,
growing exponentially.

22
00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:59.460
And to kind of get whatever they want out
of the analysis.

23
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.090
So I think a lot, this is kind of
analogous to

24
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.110
what something ideal with what it

25
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.980
is [INAUDIBLE] pre-specifies clinical
trial protocol.

26
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.820
So when you run a clinical trail, you have
to say

27
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.940
everything you're going to do, including
how you're going to analyze the data.

28
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.720
And wouldn't it be nice if someone had
just written this for you?

29
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.470
Well, if you use a

30
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.210
standardized kind of pipeline someone has
written it for you.

31
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.875
And you just, you can pre-specify exactly
what

32
00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:25.030
you can do for him for a given situation.

33
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.324
So, the basic structure of this the
cartoon of course will depend

34
00:01:28.324 --> 00:01:31.999
on what you are actually, what question
you're actually trying to ask.

35
00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:35.303
But you have some data set some minimal
input metadata perhaps

36
00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:38.322
and then there's a series of modules that
it goes through.

37
00:01:38.322 --> 00:01:41.738
Which can be quite long in the
reprocessing and sort of statistical

38
00:01:41.738 --> 00:01:44.335
methods involved in all these pieces here.

39
00:01:44.335 --> 00:01:48.439
and, and you can imagine that there'd be
like a benchmark set of

40
00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.151
data sets or data set that is used to
evaluate various types of Statistical

41
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:57.559
methods and then you can produce some sort
of report which perhaps can

42
00:01:57.559 --> 00:02:02.906
be cut and pasted into a methods sections
or posted in some public depository.

43
00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:06.850
I just wanted to do a quick case study for
what I mean by this is one of the

44
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.314
things I do a lot is estimate acute
effects of avian air pollution exposure.

45
00:02:11.314 --> 00:02:15.220
So so these are cor-relational types of
studies a lot of this

46
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.400
stuff kind of originated from the 70's and
80's so it's not.

47
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.400
We start doing this yesterday, we have a
long history of this kind of research.

48
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.760
The basic question, are short-term changes
in pollution

49
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.850
associated with short-term changes in a
population health outcome?

50
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.910
These are usually conducted at the level
of the community.

51
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.050
And we have a lot, and there's a lot

52
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.980
of statistical research that has gone,
some of it done

53
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.690
by myself, that has gone into this type of
analysis.

54
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.430
So this is what the data typically look
like.

55
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.880
We have, death counts, this is in New York
City.

56
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.990
We're going for a couple years here.

57
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.430
And then you have particulate matter
levels down here at the bottom.

58
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.910
Now you can see there's not as much
particulate matter data

59
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.890
as there is mortality data, because
there's a lot of missing data.

60
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.400
So, essentially you just want to say, is

61
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.870
this top thing correlated with the bottom
thing.

62
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.290
So question is, can we encode

63
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.828
everything that we found in the
statistical

64
00:02:59.828 --> 00:03:02.940
and epidemiological research into a single
package?

65
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.710
The answer is yes.

66
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.130
Time series studies like this don't have a
huge range of variation.

67
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.180
And so they typically involve similar
types of data.

68
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.340
You know, it might be hospitalization
instead of

69
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.940
mortality or what not, but it's often very
similar.

70
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.070
And so can we create kind of

71
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.780
a deterministic statistical machine for
this area?

72
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.420
So the basic

73
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.840
kind of pipeline that looks, it's a very
simple pipeline.

74
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.530
This is not a very complicated analysis
for the most part.

75
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.560
You want to check the data, see if there

76
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.840
are any outliers, high leverage types of
points.

77
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.880
Pollution data is often skewed, so you
want to check for that.

78
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.970
Look for overdispersion.

79
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.390
Do you want to fill in the missing data?
The answer is absolutely no.

80
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.750
There's been a lot of work on that.

81
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.850
It doesn't, it doesn't turn out well.

82
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.250
The big question really here is model
selection, so one

83
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.450
of the things that we have to worry about
is

84
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.690
called unmeasured confounding in these
types of time series studies.

85
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.430
And you don't measure a lot of things that
vary over time.

86
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.160
So I guess this is like your batch
effects.

87
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
And so you have to, there are various
approaches

88
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.250
to estimating of how you adjust these
unmeasured confounders.

89
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.100
We use semiparametric progression methods
to do this, so.

90
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.850
Estimating the degrees of freedom, this
is, has the most profound effect

91
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.860
on any kind of association that you might
estimate, so this is critical.

92
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.370
So, but, you know, there is lots

93
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.040
of research on how to do this.

94
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.560
There's been a couple of papers One is
mine.

95
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.860
One of the various approaches to e,
estimating

96
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.220
this number of degrees of freedom and
there, and

97
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.050
you can settle on a, you know, one or

98
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.900
two approaches that are That are better
than others.

99
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.530
So we can just implement that.

100
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.690
Other aspects of the model tend not to be
that important.

101
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.470
Again, whether you adjust for temperature
and weather and other

102
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.400
things it kind of doesn't really matter
how you do that.

103
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.980
There's other things that you're typically
interested

104
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.100
in, multiple lag analysis and sensitivity
analysis.

105
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.820
So you want to see, you know, you can

106
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.890
select a model here, but if you want to
see

107
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.050
if you can move the model back and forth

108
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.070
a little bit Does your association change
dramatically, right?

109
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.160
So those are the typical things that you
want to see, in this kind of analysis.

110
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.820
And when I review, you know, one paper a
month, of, of

111
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.250
a time series study these are the things
that I always ask for.

112
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.150
So.
>> Roger.

113
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.510
>> Yeah.

114
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.020
>> Is there a 15 second response to
why.

115
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.300
Computation is so bad in the setting?
>> Oh, because the data

116
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.410
are missing systematically so the, the,
the pollution data is very difficult to

117
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.370
collect, and so they typically only
measure it only once every six days.

118
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.260
So there's five days missing for every six
to eight days.

119
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.420
One observation for every six days.

120
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.410
So, you can try to imp-to inpute it but
you just

121
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.810
add a lot of noise for a little bit of
savings advice.

122
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.210
So my thinking, I, I feel like this is,
you know, you can't have one obviously.

123
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.450
There's lots of various data analysis.

124
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.530
Different problems require different
expertise.

125
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.554
I can't handle everything, obviously.

126
00:05:33.554 --> 00:05:37.430
So the idea is you can create a curated
library of these machines.

127
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.270
providing, kind of, the standardized,
state

128
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.820
of the art, analysis type, well, just

129
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.530
state of the art in can have different
meanings in different areas, obviously.

130
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.780
Time series analysis solutions are a very
well developed

131
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.300
area, there's not a lot of research,
statistical research,

132
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.440
going on, a lot of the questions have been
settled.

133
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.180
So, we could have a, kind of, archive of
these kinds of data analysis.

134
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.320
An archive for data analysis.

135
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.160
What analogy is this kind of Cochrane
Collaboration which, I don't know if

136
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.950
any of you are familiar with but

137
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.870
it's basically an archive of
evidence-based medicine.

138
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.830
So you can go to the Cochrane

139
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.890
Collaboration search for things like, you
can just

140
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.330
ask, you can search for, you know, can you
use vitamin C to treat asthma.

141
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.450
And so here, in the

142
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.490
summary it says.
You know, we reviewed evidence.

143
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.160
So, they, they just basically did
meta-analyses.

144
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.460
They reviewed evidence from nine clinical
trials of Vitamin C.

145
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.690
[COUGH] In general, the evidence, the, the
trails were very small.

146
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.756
It's not possible to recommend either the
use or the avoidance of Vitamin C.

147
00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:30.890
In asthma.
Okay so.

148
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.720
So, we don't have to worry about vitamin
C.

149
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.580
That's not going to help us, it's not
going to hurt us.

150
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.933
So, something like, so this, this is

151
00:06:36.933 --> 00:06:38.819
the basis of a lot of evidence-based
interventions,

152
00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:40.261
evidence-based treatments.

153
00:06:40.261 --> 00:06:43.852
So something like this could be done for
data analysis I think.

154
00:06:43.852 --> 00:06:48.544
So, we can have a packages that encode the
analyses

155
00:06:48.544 --> 00:06:53.050
pipelines Curated by experts, you know,
knowledgeable in the field.

156
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.140
These don't have to be perfect solutions
but it the idea is that, they'd

157
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.840
be, they'd be pretty good solutions to
kind of cover most of the bases.

158
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.020
And then so, that's kind of all

159
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.480
I wanted to say.

160
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.190
I, I think, so, I, I, I kind of did a bait
and switch.

161
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.560
I didn't really talk about reproducible
research.

162
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.570
But I do think it's important.

163
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.040
I, except for the fact I don't think

164
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.990
it Really fundamentally addresses the
utmost important question.

165
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.660
Whether you can trust the analysis.

166
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.508
And so I think, so the I think, so

167
00:07:20.508 --> 00:07:23.346
what I call this evidence based data
analysis which

168
00:07:23.346 --> 00:07:25.854
some people don't like that phrase but I
just

169
00:07:25.854 --> 00:07:29.286
come up with organized standardized best
practices for given

170
00:07:29.286 --> 00:07:31.260
scientific areas and questions.

171
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.340
And it's not that I don't think that they,
I don't think they exist.

172
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.740
Especially it's really professional kind
of

173
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.650
organizing and getting together and
honest.

174
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.070
I think this is something that could give
reviewers a

175
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.180
powerful tool and without dramatically
increasing the burden on them.

176
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.340
Like you know, requiring them to reproduce
the analysis would I think that we should

177
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.310
put more effort into kind of addressing

178
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.072
the up stream aspects of, of scientific
research.
