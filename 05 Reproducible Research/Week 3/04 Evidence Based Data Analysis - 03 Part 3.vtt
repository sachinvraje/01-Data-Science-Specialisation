1
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.710
So I just take this analogy from [UNKNOWN]
slides sometimes when I talk about asthma.

2
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.510
So if you think of different kinds of

3
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.910
asthma, allergic sensitization, and the
path of genesis.

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.040
You know you think you might have some

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.850
allergy exposure, which you brings into
your body,

6
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.070
the specific [UNKNOWN] you know
[INAUDIBLE] which has

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.270
been sensitized and these [UNKNOWN] that
to our mediators.

8
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.730
And these plans where mediators

9
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.240
create classical symptoms, of bronchial
construction,

10
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.590
mucus, generations like that.

11
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.677
And the way that we can attack this, is
primarily

12
00:00:32.677 --> 00:00:36.650
through medication So you have like your
inhaled corticosteroids over here.

13
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.190
You've got your anti-leukotriene type
modifiers over here.

14
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.085
You've got your anti-IgE type stuff over
here.

15
00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:45.750
And, and so that all does varying type of
jobs of,

16
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.280
of, affecting people's asthma But then,
there's also this part up here.

17
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.250
So one of, one of the reasons I'm excited
about a lot of this

18
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.320
environmental intervention stuff that
we're doing is that it kind

19
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.340
of affects the most upstream part of the
disease process.

20
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.270
And not only does it affect this most
upstream part.

21
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.200
But it's actually very inexpensive
relative to all this medication.

22
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.720
So, it's efficient, and it's potentially
powerful.

23
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.330
And so that's kind of this, that's kind of
nice.

24
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.170
So if you were to translate this over, to
kind

25
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.030
of a way that research is disseminated so
there's people,

26
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.940
people conducting research over here that
may be problematic,

27
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.000
it may be incorrect in terms of the
analysis.

28
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.790
They submit a paper to some journal, that
goes through some, the, and the paper

29
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.760
gets published, and after the paper's
published, you

30
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.920
get the data and you get the code.

31
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.630
And you can see what they did.

32
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.896
So, the typical kind of safe guards are,
[INAUDIBLE]

33
00:01:38.896 --> 00:01:42.230
maybe editor thinks it stinks so he
rejects it.

34
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.770
Or if they send it out then there's peer
reviews.

35
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.000
And the peer review's supposed to be a
check on something.

36
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.280
And if it, then if it gets past your
review it gets published, so

37
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.580
that's where reproducible research comes
in at

38
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.750
the most downstream aspect of the process.

39
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.280
And so there's a lot of discussion now
about doing this, and so the

40
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.860
idea is that okay well why would wait for
all the data and the

41
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.440
code to available after the thing is
published.

42
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.700
Why not do it as part of the publication
process?

43
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.020
And I think that's, that's a noble goal,
but I think totally unrealistic.

44
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.370
Because I don't think it's realistic to

45
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.360
expect peer reviewers to kind of reproduce
everything.

46
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.240
I speak from experience.

47
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.570
So Of those of you who are not in
statistics, you know, are not

48
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.810
used to waiting the typical six to twelve
months for your review to come in.

49
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.070
And if you add on top of that the need to

50
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.120
reproduce the entire analysis you would be
promoted 40 years from now.

51
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.060
So so, so that's reasonable and I'll give
an example of that.

52
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.400
But I think the questions well, is there
something we can do?

53
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.720
I mean in the most upstream part of this
process.

54
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.750
And so that's what I want to talk about
today.

55
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.710
So this one example of moving the
reproducible part to the peer reviewed

56
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.790
passport, it's not exactly up here but
it's somewhere up screen a little bit.

57
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.790
This is just, we have a policy at the

58
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.240
journal of bio statistics, which is easily
the best

59
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.930
statistics journal in the world, and and
I'm the

60
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.240
associate editor for what's called the
associate editor for reproducibility.

61
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.020
And we have a very light policy, it's
totally voluntary,

62
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.010
where you can submit your date and your
code to the

63
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.920
editor, the associate editor for
reproducibility

64
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.740
and he, [INAUDIBLE], will reproduce it.

65
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.680
And if you if it's not a very, it's not a
hundred percent fool

66
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.150
proof policy but it's never happened that
I haven't been able to reproduce anything.

67
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.040
But if you, it is really useful, you get

68
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.920
this little R stamped on the top of your
paper.

69
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.670
Now there's two other options, there's a D
and a C.

70
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.270
If you submit your code, then you get a
little C over there.

71
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.440
I don't check that, I just assume that's
fine.

72
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.580
If you submit your data, you get a D.

73
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.780
If you submit your data and your code, you
get a D and a C.

74
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.550
And if I reproduce it, you get an R.

75
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.804
So and then this is Jeff's only
contribution to this work.

76
00:03:59.804 --> 00:04:03.420
[LAUGH] And [UNKNOWN] these papers.

77
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.510
He got an R.

78
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.350
And it took me a week to reproduce it, but
it was fine.

79
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.160
So anyway, so that's one model.

80
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.260
This is not really a kind of a deterrents,
so to speak,

81
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.350
because it's old voluntary happens after
the paper is deceptive from pure evil.

82
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:25.112
So but, anyway so this is one model
[UNKNOWN].
