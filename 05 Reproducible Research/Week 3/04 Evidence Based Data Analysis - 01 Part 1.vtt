00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.240
I'm going to talk a little about,
replication, reproducibility.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.290
And I think in a lot of,

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.620
circumstances, people tend to use these
words interchangeably.

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.550
But for the purpose of this talk,
[UNKNOWN].

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.270
There's going to be a distinction.

6
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.607
So, when I think, when I think about
replication, I think

7
00:00:15.607 --> 00:00:17.910
we talk about like the usual thing that
happens in science.

8
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.050
The purpose of replication is to address,
in my

9
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.370
opinion, the kind of validity of a
scientific claim, right?

10
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.110
So if you say that x is related to y.

11
00:00:25.138 --> 00:00:27.880
The first question is well is this claim
true?

12
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.320
So you have to replicate it in another
study or a series of other studies.

13
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.525
With new investigators collecting new data
using different

14
00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:41.758
alloquital methods, laboratory instruments
whatever it may be.

15
00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:43.980
And you have a bunch of replications and
no one can sign, no one

16
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.140
can find the same thing now you think
okay, well that's probably not true.

17
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.640
But if everyone finds the same thing,
roughly the same thing, in independent

18
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.020
studies, then you think okay, that's
probably a reasonable claim.

19
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.260
So replication's kind of how we've always
done things.

20
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.508
And it's still, I think, the

21
00:00:58.508 --> 00:01:01.050
ultimate standard for strengthening
scientific evidence.

22
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.450
So that's replication.

23
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.690
Reproducibility in case you haven't heard
the term is y referred

24
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.270
to as kind of saying the validity of the
data analysis right?

25
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.530
So here you have situations where data are

26
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.930
collected and you analyze with someone
else and

27
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.540
they say something like x is related to y.

28
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.060
So here the idea is that you have two
investigators but you

29
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.240
look at the same data and, and you used
the same methods, perhaps.

30
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.980
See if, you know, what they claimed is

31
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.100
actually produced from the data that, and
the analysis.

32
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.800
So the real question, I think the question
here is not so much, Is the claim true?

33
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.940
But really, Can we trust this analysis?
Okay?

34
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.090
So that's kind of, in, what I see, the,
the key question

35
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.950
of reproducibility tries to address.

36
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.650
Can we take their approach, apply to their

37
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.260
data, and get the same thing that they've
gotten?

38
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.368
And I think this is key.

39
00:01:49.368 --> 00:01:52.420
A reproducibility is, is particularly hard
in my area

40
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.690
of work in, in which replication is just
not possible.

41
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.606
So this is where I'm starting.

42
00:01:59.606 --> 00:02:03.380
And just so, I think some background
everyone's familiar with this

43
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.580
is, there's been a lot of talk about
reproducibility in recent years.

44
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.860
Some of the transars just have, a lot of
stages that can't replicated they're huge.

45
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.450
I switched edimology and have these 25
year covert studies that just can't

46
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.476
be replicated in a reasonable amount of
time.

47
00:02:16.476 --> 00:02:20.582
There's a lot of technology, which is
affecting the rate of data collection.

48
00:02:20.582 --> 00:02:22.160
The complexity is very high.

49
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.590
You have these, kind of, databases that
people are

50
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.460
just merging together like crazy, I'm one
of those people.

51
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.612
And I've seen a lot of these data used off
label.

52
00:02:31.612 --> 00:02:34.918
So for example you have administrative
data sets that are being used

53
00:02:34.918 --> 00:02:38.350
for health studies and things like that so
this is very common.

54
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.534
And then because it's inexpensive
computing

55
00:02:40.534 --> 00:02:42.158
power is very sophisticated now so

56
00:02:42.158 --> 00:02:45.180
we can do very kid of complex analysis on
just small data sets.

57
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.660
And so, and then for every field x, there
is a computational x.

58
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.160
So.

59
00:02:52.168 --> 00:02:55.470
To sum up the results, so basic analysis
can be very difficult to, to

60
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.306
describe now, in just kind of like your
standard method section in a journal.

61
00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:03.010
Oftentimes there's very heavy
computational requirements that

62
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.150
are thrust on people with very little
training.

63
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.930
And so just a little bit of the context
that kind of, from where coming, I,

64
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.490
I think, you think of the range of kind of
computational ability from low to high.

65
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.640
You know, most of the people in the room
are over here.

66
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.924
All the people in the room are over here,
maybe, you know, Jeff's over here.

67
00:03:19.924 --> 00:03:25.080
[LAUGH] But there's a whole slew of people
on this end of the spectrum.

68
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.700
Who are doing computational, who have to
do computational work for, whether they

69
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.040
like it or not, and the reasons they've
got all this data coming in.

70
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.160
So and so that can lead to problems.

71
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.760
You can have errors introduced into
long-term analysis pipelines.

72
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.000
And you can't tell people what you've done
in a reasonable

73
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.260
amount of space.

74
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.200
That complicates the transfer of
knowledge.

75
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.959
So in many cases, there is a sense that
complicated analyses can't be trusted.
