[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:07.821
One of the nice things about using R
Markdown knitr and R Studio

3
00:00:07.821 --> 00:00:12.229
together is is a little service that R
Studio provides called R Pubs.

4
00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:15.000
So I thought I'd bring that up, just to
show you kind of how it works, here.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.765
So we go to rpubs.com.

6
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.610
You can see that this website is brought
to you by R

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.750
studio, and you need to you need to create
an account on here.

8
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.070
So the basic idea is that once you've
created

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.020
an account you can publish, mark down, or
knitr documents

10
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.060
to the website that can be used to share
with

11
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.040
people, share with other people and share
with the public.

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.090
So the first thing you need to do is
register for an account, so

13
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.600
you can just enter your name, and your
email, and your username and a password.

14
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.040
Once you've got your account, then you can
start publishing things to RPubs.

15
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.070
So, I'm going to sign in here.

16
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.060
I've already got an account, and so, and
then you can go to my, I can

17
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.740
go to my account page, look at my

18
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.330
profile and see, I haven't really
published anything.

19
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.670
And so why don't we, try to publish
something here.

20
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.660
So let me put this away.

21
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.959
I'll start up R studio.

22
00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:07.270
And as R studio starts up here you can see
I've

23
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.270
already got a markdown document here on
the left, as part of

24
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.000
a demo and so maybe the first thing I'll
do is I'll

25
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.640
just I'll knit it and I'll see what the
HTML looks like.

26
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.680
And you can see here it says, basically
I'm loading the air quality data set here.

27
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.610
I'm making a paris plot of the variables
in the air quality data set.

28
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.280
And then if you go down a little bit, I'm
fitting

29
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.720
a linear model of ozone and on wind, solar
radiation, and temperature.

30
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.220
And then I have the results of the linear
model here.

31
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.760
So nothing too special but I want to be
able to share this with the world.

32
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.110
So you'll notice at the top of the preview

33
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.050
window here I I can, there's a publish
button.

34
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.280
So I can hit, I mean just click on

35
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.850
the publish button you'll, you'll get a
little notice

36
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.070
about R pubs and you can just can click on
publish.

37
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.410
And if your already signed into your
account at our

38
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.030
Pubs it will put it, it'll bring it right
there.

39
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.940
If you're not here I'll bring you up
Safari so, and so, you can give it a

40
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.446
little title give it a little description
here So, some analysis

41
00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:13.210
of the air quality data set in R.

42
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.030
And you can give it a little identifier
here if you want to or you

43
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.000
can just let it, you can just not do
anything, just hit, just click continue.

44
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.220
You can see up here at the top that it
gave it a little

45
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.370
identifier here 11879, so this is the kind
of permit URL for this analysis.

46
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.470
And you can see it looks just like the
HTML output that was shown in R studio in

47
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.130
the preview window, but now it's on a
website And you can share

48
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.660
this with people.
People can comment on it.

49
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.070
There's a comment button here.

50
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.350
You can click on the share button, here.

51
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.762
You can send it to, various social
networks or email it to someone.

52
00:02:47.762 --> 00:02:50.150
So it's a really useful service.
It's totally free.

53
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.230
The one thing that is important to

54
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.830
remember is that everything that you put
on

55
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.100
here is public, immediately, so there's no

56
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.600
there's no time period in which it's
private.

57
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.120
And so you need to be careful just to make
sure

58
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.410
that you don't publish anything that you
didn't mean to publish.

59
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.350
Of course, if you,

60
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.200
if you did publish something by accident,
you

61
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.670
could always delete it down here at the
bottom.

62
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.610
so, that's RPubs.

63
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.990
It's a really useful service for
publishing and sharing kind of

64
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.210
statistical analyses that are written in R
Markdown and using Knitr.

65
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.350
And I think it's worth a try.
