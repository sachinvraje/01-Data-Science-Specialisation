1
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.640
So the other question is, who reproduces
research?

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.300
And I think, this is, I don't know, I'm
not in, this area of,

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.360
kind of, genomics and computational
[UNKNOWN], I

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.850
don't know how much this is an issue.

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.875
But, it's a big issue for me, the, so, in
order for

6
00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:19.040
reproducibility to be effective in any
way, someone has to do something, right?

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.150
So if I just say I published this paper,
and it's reproducible.

8
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.035
That doesn't necessarily mean anything,
until you get your

9
00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:27.000
hands on, or someone gets their hands on
the data

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.560
coding, and looks at it, and does

11
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.310
something, and maybe even reproduces it,
right?

12
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.510
So someone has to do something.

13
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.420
You have to rerun the analysis.

14
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.310
Check the code, whatever, try some
alternative approaches.

15
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.850
So I think, and this is kind of, in my
sense, it's

16
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.368
kind of the analog of replication, it's
kind of inherited from that tradition.

17
00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:44.470
But the question of who is something and
what is their goal?

18
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.840
Who is this someone and what are their
goals, is very important, and the way

19
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.684
that I kind of characterize it is that

20
00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:52.142
there's kind of three different types of
people

21
00:00:52.142 --> 00:00:53.850
who may want to reproduce your research.

22
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.406
So if you are the original investigator up
here, you say that the truth is A.

23
00:00:57.406 --> 00:01:02.208
There's one group, the general public who
doesn't care.

24
00:01:02.208 --> 00:01:08.340
So that's so that's a large, that's the
largest group of people.

25
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.110
Then there's one called scientists who
either agree

26
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.510
with you maybe that they, that they agree

27
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.880
with, they think the truth is A they may
also, but they also may think the

28
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.600
truth is B.
Okay, so that's fine.

29
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.589
Everyone's got a hypothesis about how the
world works.

30
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.590
And then there's this group of people over
here which believes that

31
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.085
the truth is just whatever the opposite,
it's not whatever you're saying.

32
00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:32.395
>> [LAUGH]

33
00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:36.100
>> And the size of the boxes is
proportional to kind of the

34
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.940
likelihood that these people, that the
people

35
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.528
in that box will reproduce your work.

36
00:01:39.528 --> 00:01:40.450
>> [LAUGH]

37
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.890
>> Scientists like you are likely to
reproduce it, but they're kind

38
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.020
of busy doing their own thing.

39
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.459
So, so there's an issue here that this, in
my opinion, is not really science.

40
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.050
They don't have a specific idea of how the
world works.

41
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.070
They just want to know that it's different
from whatever you're saying.

42
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.650
And so they're very interested in
reproducing my work.

43
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.000
I had it, and thankfully, my work's mostly
been, almost all has been reproducible.

44
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.050
So, so I'm fine with that but it

45
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.000
has the potential to make your personal
life miserable.

46
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.520
So,

47
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.420
so, so far my thinking is that you know,
so reproducing brings

48
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.285
transparency which is critical I think,

49
00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:17.390
and,um, also increases the transfer of
knowledge.

50
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.940
There's a lot of discussion about how to

51
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.390
get people to share data, which is
important.

52
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.640
Data sharing is key, obviously for
reproducibility.

53
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.610
But I think the key question of can we
trust this

54
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.930
analysis that we see up there

55
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.010
is not fundamentally addressed by
reproducibility.

56
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.750
And so further more, reproducibility is
this very down stream

57
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.860
type of element.

58
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.262
And a lot of these secondary types of
analysis are coloured by the

59
00:02:39.262 --> 00:02:43.691
interests and motivations of others, and I
spelled coloured with a u for Candice.

60
00:02:43.691 --> 00:02:47.982
So so this, so that brings us to what I
call evidence-based data analysis.

61
00:02:47.982 --> 00:02:51.566
And so, I think no one will, everyone
here's familiar with the idea that,

62
00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:55.870
you know, a true data analysis involves
stringing together a whole lot of things.

63
00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.060
Lots of tools, lots of methods, as this
long pipeline of stuff that you

64
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.898
have to do to do any real data analysis.

65
00:03:02.898 --> 00:03:05.970
And so, a lot of times the methods are
standard, you know,

66
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.680
everyone does the same thing for a given
piece of the pipeline.

67
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.460
Or, if there's no standard, then you just
kind

68
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.299
of make up whatever you want to do, right?

69
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.270
So and the basic idea is, I think, if,

70
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.920
and, to kind of what I, that I want to
kind of

71
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.430
translate to kind of a lot of climatical
science is

72
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.167
that we should just use thoroughly
applied, thoroughly studied methods

73
00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:30.370
that are that we kind of agree upon in our
subgroups in the

74
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.778
scientific, the scientific community, that
these are the appropriate methods to use.

75
00:03:33.778 --> 00:03:35.250
You don't have to be perfect, but we have

76
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.769
to kind of, these, hopefully they're like
the 85% solution.

77
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.140
And there should be evidence to justify
the application of certain

78
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.970
methods, and you know, as statisticians,
we do this all the time.

79
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.994
We, prepare different methods, you know,
either

80
00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:48.730
by simulation or [COUGH] theory or what
not.

81
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.310
I mean you kind of say, which method is

82
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.740
more appropriate in certain, in a given
circumstance?

83
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.730
So, just a very quick example.

84
00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.700
This is a histogram that generated R I
just took hist x and, you know, of course,

85
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.720
the histogram is just a smoother, and the
most

86
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.720
important thing in a smoother is the bin,
right?

87
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.680
So I didn't do anything I just made this
histogram, so how did the bin get chosen?

88
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.290
So it turns out there was a paper written
by Sturgis

89
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.761
in 1926, published in [UNKNOWN], paper is
actual a very generous term

90
00:04:16.761 --> 00:04:20.830
this thing was like this long, but Booth
suggested that the band,

91
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.700
the bandwidth should be done according to
this, you know, formula basically.

92
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.610
Later on, when the kind of kernel
smoothing became

93
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.770
popular, David Scott wrote a paper in
Biometrico of

94
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.890
which talked about, you know, choosing the
bandwidth based

95
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.082
on kind of the integrated means for
multivariate measures.

96
00:04:33.082 --> 00:04:37.380
So anyways, the default bandwidth is just
programmed in and there it is, alright?

97
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.480
No one argues for the most part with, with
him,

98
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.980
sometimes when they get smaller and bigger
that's fine but use

99
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.090
the default.

100
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.130
It's pretty good, and there's actually
some

101
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.257
research behind what that bandwidth should
be.
