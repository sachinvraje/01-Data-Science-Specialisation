2
00:00:05.443 --> 00:00:08.771
In this lecture I'm just going to present
the short checklist

3
00:00:08.771 --> 00:00:11.971
of things that I think you should think
about when doing

4
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:15.555
any sort of data analysis project or any
sort of investigation

5
00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:19.412
involving a lot of data and, and kind of
processing and analysis.

6
00:00:19.412 --> 00:00:23.162
This by no means a comprehensive checklist
and it doesn't come with necessarily any

7
00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:26.802
guarantees that everything is going to go
well for you, if you follow the checklist.

8
00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:30.462
But I think over the through my
experience, and through the

9
00:00:30.462 --> 00:00:33.024
experience of you know people I worked
with a lot of

10
00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:35.952
the items that I'm going to talk about in
this checklist I

11
00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:39.002
think are important, and, and will at
least be a basis

12
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:42.267
for you to kind of do your analysis in a
reproducible manner.

13
00:00:42.267 --> 00:00:43.947
All right, so, I'm just going to, just a
couple

14
00:00:43.947 --> 00:00:45.926
of do's and don'ts that I'm going to go
through.

15
00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:47.837
And then at the end I'll summarize, kind
of,

16
00:00:47.837 --> 00:00:50.002
the basic questions that you want to ask
yourself.

17
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:52.477
Any time your doing any sort of data

18
00:00:52.477 --> 00:00:55.777
analysis or project that's kind of beyond
a trivial

19
00:00:55.777 --> 00:00:57.052
kind of analysis.

20
00:00:57.052 --> 00:00:59.842
[BLANK_AUDIO]

21
00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:02.582
So, the first thing you want to start with
is some good science.

22
00:01:02.582 --> 00:01:05.886
So, and the idea here is you gotta be
working on something that's

23
00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:09.920
interesting to you, that you think is to
come interesting to other people.

24
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.300
Because if you start with something that's
but,

25
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.550
that you don't like or you don't think

26
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.180
is good, then you're just going to end up

27
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.840
probably with something that's not good on
the out.

28
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.120
So, garbage in, garbage out is the, is
the, is the basic idea here.

29
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.170
So start with some good science.

30
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.210
And we're, and make sure you have a, a
question or

31
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.168
a goal that's relatively focused and
coherent.

32
00:01:28.168 --> 00:01:30.456
it, that's not always possible, depending
on the

33
00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:32.610
types of, of problems that you're working
on.

34
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.563
But in general, the more coherent and
focused question that you can,

35
00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:40.700
fo, then you can work on the simpler that
your problem will be.

36
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.934
And because, because a narrower question
or a more focused type of question tends

37
00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:48.592
to rule out a lot of possibilities that
you won't have to worry about.

38
00:01:48.592 --> 00:01:50.462
But if you have a very broad and very
vague

39
00:01:50.462 --> 00:01:53.652
type of question then you'll have lots of
things to deal with and

40
00:01:53.652 --> 00:01:55.137
lots of things to think about and

41
00:01:55.137 --> 00:01:57.690
generally increase the complexity of your
problem.

42
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.030
Of course you should always work with
people who

43
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.904
are good collaborators, people who you'd
like to work with.

44
00:02:03.904 --> 00:02:08.384
People that, you think that have a good
kind of, working relationship with, with,

45
00:02:08.384 --> 00:02:10.904
because we don't have good working
relationships,

46
00:02:10.904 --> 00:02:13.240
then this can lead to other bad practices.

47
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.740
So good work collaborators generally
reinforce

48
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.230
good work practices.

49
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.160
And of course make sure that something
that is interesting to you.

50
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.530
Because if you are interested in the idea
then hopefully

51
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.700
that will motivate you to kind of have
some good habits.

52
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.610
So, in just, so the first thing you should
always deal with is, you know,

53
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.360
start with something that's good, start
with some

54
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.010
good science, start with some good
interesting topics.

55
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.970
I think if there's one rule, if I were to
boil everything down to

56
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.570
one rule when it comes to reproducibility,
it would be don't do things by hand.

57
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.990
Alright, so doing things by hand is

58
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.802
usually where most investigations get
tripped up.

59
00:02:45.802 --> 00:02:49.800
and, and were things that were not
reproducible come into play.

60
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.740
And so I just give a couple of examples

61
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.940
here of things that are often done by
hand.

62
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.220
The first, the first one being, you know,
editing a spreadsheet.

63
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.960
So if you use something like Microsoft
Excel

64
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.240
or something, or a similar type of
program.

65
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.837
It's all, it's, it's tempting to kind of
load the data

66
00:03:02.837 --> 00:03:05.390
in Excel, and then just clean up some of
the messy data.

67
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.810
Like you might have some outliers

68
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.990
that you just want to remove, or if your
doing some QA QC you know, on the

69
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.450
data and some values might be, you know,
out of the range or something like that.

70
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.530
So you just fix them right there.

71
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.480
You might validate certain types of
measurements like by using,

72
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.418
you know, a couple of experts or something
like that.

73
00:03:22.418 --> 00:03:24.080
These kinds of things are very easy to do.

74
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.630
And it's particularly in spreadsheet
programs

75
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.900
and it's very tempting to do that.

76
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.940
But the problem with doing that kind of
kind of in

77
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.600
the spreadsheet analysis is that it's not
really reproducible at all.

78
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.210
Unless you write down exactly what you
did, and how you

79
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.820
did it, and what were the criteria for
doing certain things.

80
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.250
For example, if you're going to remove
outliers, what's the

81
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.300
criteria for determining what an outlier
is etc like that.

82
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.350
So unless you write down everything very
precisely like

83
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.440
that editing a spreadsheet by hand is
often not reproducible.

84
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.440
And so you should try to avoid it if you
can.

85
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.394
Editing things like tables and figures of,
this is maybe less of an issue.

86
00:04:02.394 --> 00:04:05.290
But it still may be, leads us to something
that's not reproducible.

87
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.800
For example, we change if you change the

88
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.550
rounding in a table, or something like
that.

89
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.674
that can be, lead to, lead to something
that is not reproducible.

90
00:04:14.674 --> 00:04:17.530
Something as innocuous is maybe
downloading data from

91
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.450
a website, which maybe you do you might

92
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.610
have to do a lot, if you're, you're

93
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.570
kind of assembling many different data
set, data

94
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.810
sets.

95
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.320
You might think that well, this is very
simple.

96
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.338
I'm just going to open my web browser,
click on a link, and download a data set.

97
00:04:29.338 --> 00:04:31.428
But that's again, that's something that
you do by hand.

98
00:04:31.428 --> 00:04:34.728
And if you were going to tell someone how,
how to, someone else

99
00:04:34.728 --> 00:04:37.938
how to do it there would be a lengthy set
of instructions.

100
00:04:37.938 --> 00:04:40.503
You, you'd have to tell them you know,
what website

101
00:04:40.503 --> 00:04:42.676
to go to, what link to click on and etc.

102
00:04:42.676 --> 00:04:45.460
So that's something that you should be
careful

103
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.722
about and you should, make sure you write
down

104
00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:49.578
everything that you did.

105
00:04:49.578 --> 00:04:51.890
Because it, it can determine whether
someone else can kind of

106
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.430
obtain the same data set to do the
analysis that you did.

107
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.350
Even something simple like moving data
around, moving files around on your

108
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.200
computer or maybe taking a large data file
and splitting it in half.

109
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.120
If you do these by hand, there's no record
of you ever doing it.

110
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.070
And, so someone wants to repeat what you
did, they have no instructions

111
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.230
for how to do it or where to move things
or what to do.

112
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.760
So, you should

113
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.840
think about this before you do them.

114
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.860
If you can, and, and ask yourself if it's,
if it's really necessary to do.

115
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.570
And if it is then you should document it
carefully.

116
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.230
it's, it's always very tempting especially
in the beginning of

117
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.796
analysis to think, well we're just
going to do this once.

118
00:05:27.796 --> 00:05:29.336
So we don't really need to, kind of write

119
00:05:29.336 --> 00:05:31.300
a computer program to do it or something
like that.

120
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.733
Or write it down very carefully.

121
00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:35.633
For example you might only download the
data just once.

122
00:05:35.633 --> 00:05:38.847
And so you don't need to kind of automate
that procedure.

123
00:05:38.847 --> 00:05:41.925
But just be careful with any, if you find
yourself saying we're

124
00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:45.687
going to do this just once, make sure you
still, everything is documented and,

125
00:05:45.687 --> 00:05:48.651
and set to the point where someone else
who doesn't know you or

126
00:05:48.651 --> 00:05:50.646
doesn't work with you could, could

127
00:05:50.646 --> 00:05:53.287
potentially repeat what you're about to
do.

128
00:05:53.287 --> 00:05:56.821
And so the general rule is that, why, the
reason you shouldn't do things

129
00:05:56.821 --> 00:06:01.300
by hand is because anything that you do by
hand has to be precisely documented.

130
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.950
And this is a task, from my experience,
this is a task

131
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.306
that is much, much harder than it sounds.

132
00:06:06.306 --> 00:06:08.110
Because things, little details that you
may not

133
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.002
think are important are actually very
important to

134
00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:11.586
other people when they don't have the same

135
00:06:11.586 --> 00:06:13.479
context and the same background that you
have.

136
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.010
Next rule is is related to the first and

137
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.810
involves not using the point and click
type software.

138
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.391
And so there's a lot of software that

139
00:06:24.391 --> 00:06:27.220
has what are called graphical user
interfaces, or GUIs.

140
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.120
And graphical user interfaces are very
convenient,

141
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.690
they're very nice, they're very, often
very

142
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.040
intuitive and easy for most people to use,
they don't involve a lot of instruction.

143
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.040
And so it's nice to use a GUI and a lot of
software has these types of interfaces.

144
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.800
But the

145
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.220
problem is that a lot of the actions that
you take with

146
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.202
a GUI, like pointing and clicking are
difficult for others to reproduce.

147
00:06:48.202 --> 00:06:51.950
So unless you specifically write down,
here, I clicked on this menu, and then I

148
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.640
clicked on this option it's difficult for
someone else to know exactly what you did.

149
00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.980
So that's the danger of using things,
using graphical user interfaces

150
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.220
in any type, any type of data processing
or statistical analysis.

151
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.560
Some programs, if they have a GUI,

152
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.900
will produce the, a log file or a script
that includes the

153
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.970
kind of equivalent commands that to the
pointing and clicking that you did.

154
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.786
And so these log files and scripts can be
saved and can

155
00:07:18.786 --> 00:07:22.798
be examined by another person in the
future if, if they have to.

156
00:07:22.798 --> 00:07:26.298
So in general any data analysis software
or data processing

157
00:07:26.298 --> 00:07:30.060
software that is highly interactive you
should be careful of.

158
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.750
Because interactive software

159
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.675
tends to be very nice to use and you can
kind of do a lot of

160
00:07:34.675 --> 00:07:37.145
exploratory things with it, but this ease
of

161
00:07:37.145 --> 00:07:39.702
use can come at the price of
reproducibility.

162
00:07:39.702 --> 00:07:43.986
And so just be careful when you are using
interactive software that doesn't

163
00:07:43.986 --> 00:07:47.420
oh, that doesn't log what you do or keep
track of the history.

164
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.160
now, of course, there may be other
software

165
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.860
packages that you use that are not
directly

166
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.800
related to the analysis of data or, or the
kind of, or the kind of data

167
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.510
analysis pipeline.
Which may have GUI's and that's fine.

168
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:03.010
For example, like your graph editor may
have a graphical user interface and that,

169
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.092
something that you use to write the code
or, or to write a report.

170
00:08:06.092 --> 00:08:08.980
And that is usually, that is usually fine.

171
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.920
Because your analysis may not depend
critically

172
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.150
on exactly which text editor you use.

173
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.230
However, if on that rare case it does,
then you

174
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.710
need to be careful that everything is kind
of appropriately documented.
