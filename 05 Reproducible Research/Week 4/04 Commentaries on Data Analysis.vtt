Hi, everyone.
I just wanted to point out two

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.930
commentaries that Jeff Leak and
I recently published on the proceedings of

3
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.310
a National Academy of Sciences
in the journal, Science.

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.150
So first one is basically
about the idea of treating

5
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.160
poor data analysis as a problem
that should be prevented.

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.550
So it's kinda taking like
a disease type of analogy here and

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.720
how do we prevent
the disease from occurring.

8
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.520
So this is very related to the evidence
based data analysis lectures that you've

9
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.760
already seen in this course.

10
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.490
And we've taken the time to write up a
summary of kinda what we believe should be

11
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.106
done and how best we can address the
problem of preventing poor analysis from

12
00:00:36.106 --> 00:00:39.550
happening and
from being published in the literature.

13
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.130
The second commentary which was
published in Science recently is about

14
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.120
framing the question in a data analysis,
and how if you inappropriately

15
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.930
identify the question, then it will lead
to kind of problems with reproducibility.

16
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.620
Because there are many different kinds
of data analyses that you can do.

17
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.080
And not all of them you would expect
the results to be reproduced, for

18
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.500
example if you had a highly
exploratory analysis

19
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.600
where you were just looking for different
interesting predictors that you might

20
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.150
wanna follow up within
a more careful study.

21
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.500
Well, the highly exploratory or
even descriptive type of analysis

22
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.590
is one type of analysis that we might
use to kind of generate hypotheses or

23
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.010
to generate ideas, but we don't expect it
to be the be all and the end all analysis.

24
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.240
On the other hand, you might have
a more confirmative type of analysis

25
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.450
where you have a very carefully
designed either trial, or a study.

26
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.740
Where your trying to confirm
that two things are associated.

27
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.330
Maybe a drug improved people
with a certain disease,

28
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.000
improves the health of people
with a certain disease.

29
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.710
Or maybe it eliminates
certain types of problems.

30
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.810
So when you have more confirmatory type
of analysis that you're trying to do,

31
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.090
then things have to be done
much more carefully, and

32
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.340
there often have to be pre-specified
protocols and things like that.

33
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.750
So, in many ways one can kind of

34
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.780
sort the evidence produced by various
publications by first identifying,

35
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.930
what is the question that's being asked
and what type of analysis is being done?

36
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.320
Cuz then we can set our expectations about
what we expect to see in the analysis.

37
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.640
And what we would expect to kind of
be reproduced further down the line.

38
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.027
So I encourage you to take a look at these
commentaries and to see what you think.
