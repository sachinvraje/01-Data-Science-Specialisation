00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:08.638
Hey everyone, this lecture features Keith
Baggerly, who is a professor

3
00:00:08.638 --> 00:00:11.563
in the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics
Department

4
00:00:11.563 --> 00:00:13.549
at the MD Anderson Cancer Center.

5
00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.941
Here in this lecture, he's talking about a
case that happened with some

6
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:20.893
researchers at Duke University regarding
using

7
00:00:20.893 --> 00:00:25.370
high dimensional genomic signatures in
cancer outcomes.

8
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.470
So take a look at this lecture.

9
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.738
It's a really important story and I think
there are

10
00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.170
a lot of important lessons that you can

11
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.412
learn from the experience that you went
through.

12
00:00:35.412 --> 00:00:35.978
>> Okay.

13
00:00:35.978 --> 00:00:38.720
So, thank you for sticking around for the
very last session.

14
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.680
We're in the home stretch.

15
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.880
And I really appreciate you being here.
So that's a very good thing.

16
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.650
And I want to talk a lot about a theme
that we haven't focused on explicitly

17
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.570
in this conference so far, which is the

18
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.710
importance of reproducible research in
high throughput biology.

19
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.070
As these, as we're generating better and
better essays, and we're generating more

20
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.140
and more measurements, thousands of
things,

21
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.770
it becomes increasingly important since
the analysis

22
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.590
takes a larger and larger chunk of time
That at some stage, not

23
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.570
only us, but others, should be able to
precisely reproduce what we did.

24
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.770
In other words, if they start with the

25
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.890
same numbers, should they get the same
results?

26
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.490
And we'd like that to be true.

27
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.840
Now, this is actually really important in
high-throughput

28
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.630
biology for a somewhat different reason.
Which is simply that.

29
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.340
And once I will get this advanced then we
will tell you what it is.

30
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.840
Let's see.

31
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.870
Okay, well, I can gesture and I can tell
you what it is.

32
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.170
Which is simply that our intuition about
what makes

33
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.020
sense in high-throughput biology actually
is pretty darn poor.

34
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.060
What I mean by that is that in many cases,
I've worked

35
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.620
with clinicians where I've gone in and
said, this gene has gone up.

36
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.290
And that means these people are most, more
likely to develop advance cancer.

37
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.328
And the clinician turned to me and said
no, what that means is that you've

38
00:01:58.328 --> 00:02:01.219
got strumble contamination in your samples
because I've worked with

39
00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.409
that gene for 15 years and I know how it
behaves.

40
00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:04.380
And they're right.

41
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.000
They have intuition for single genes.

42
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.790
On the other hand, if I go to that same
clinician and I give

43
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.500
them a, the following signature of 100
genes and I say this goes up.

44
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.530
Well, they all stare at this list at 100
genes and they'll say yeah,

45
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.500
I can see that because this will influence
this and this will influence this.

46
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.490
And it's wonderful it's a Rorschach test
for biologists to give

47
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.250
them a gene list of 100 things.

48
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.730
And unfortunately we've tried the null
experiment of giving a random

49
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.030
list to some of our biologists and they
still find patterns.

50
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.030
So this is somewhat of a warning.

51
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.610
Now, in light of this, we find it somewhat

52
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.030
dismaying that when we go to the
literature and we

53
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.830
take a, take a typical paper, and we try
to

54
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.470
figure out what was done, the
documentation is often poor.

55
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.770
And if the documentation is poor, in some
cases, if the finding

56
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.020
is important, we are forced to resort to
what

57
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.750
we have come to refer to as Forensic
Bioinformatics.

58
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.420
Which involves starting with the results
and the

59
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.750
raw data and saying what must they have

60
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.510
done to get from one place to the

61
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.675
other, regardless of what the methods say
they did.

62
00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:05.290
Okay?

63
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.090
And I want to illustrate this, and how
important

64
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.460
this might be, by considering a specific
clinical example.

65
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.410
Specifically using signatures,

66
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.880
genomic signatures, to try to predict
response to chemo-sensitivity.

67
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.270
And this is actually based on work that
appeared

68
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.510
a few years ago now at the end of 2006.

69
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.040
This is a paper that showed up in Nature
Medicine and what they said,

70
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.800
what they claim in this paper was that
they figured out a really great thing.

71
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.510
Specifically, starting with cell lines,
they figured out how to come

72
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.480
up with genomic signatures of sensitivity
to a whole bunch of drugs.

73
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.910
So here's how this worked, they're

74
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.730
not just working with any panelist,
[INAUDIBLE].

75
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.740
They're working with the NC160, and the
NC160 as was

76
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.380
eluded to in the last talk, is a very
special thing.

77
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.590
One reason it's very special is that it's
a

78
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.280
standard panel maintained by the National
Cancer Institute and what

79
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.370
that means, is that if you've got a new
chemotherapeutic,

80
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.100
that agent will be sent to the National
Cancer Institute.

81
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.750
And they will test it for efficacy against
this panel of 60 cell lines.

82
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.040
And that takes, that information about
which drugs

83
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.340
are most effective against which cells,
that's public data.

84
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.310
You can go and you can download it and you

85
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.830
can download this information for every
single chemotherapeutic now available.

86
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.150
So, if you configure it, how to leverage
that information, that's potentially a way

87
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.470
to use or choose the best single drug
that's out there for a given patient.

88
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.750
So what they said was they said, okay if
using the NCI60, let's start with a drug

89
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.430
of interest like Docetaxel.

90
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.870
Let's pick the sudden most sensitive, and
most resistant cell lines.

91
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.560
Okay, those are our extremes.

92
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.080
Let's take array profiles of those cell
lines, okay, fine.

93
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.010
Let us contrast them and identify the
genes that

94
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.450
are most different between group one and
group two.

95
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.550
These genes will comprise elements of our

96
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.840
sensitivity signature and then they say
let's fit

97
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.000
a model to come up with the sensitivity
signature and for doing this they use meta

98
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.422
genes which sounds really cool.

99
00:04:56.422 --> 00:04:58.740
But to mathematicians, we otherwise know
it as

100
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.450
principal components and I'm going to use
that terminology.

101
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.525
And they're going to say okay, using these
meta

102
00:05:04.525 --> 00:05:07.525
genes lets try to fit the cells lines and
predict

103
00:05:07.525 --> 00:05:10.750
on clinical samples and they tried this
with a whole

104
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.626
bunch of public data sets using seven
commonly used agents.

105
00:05:14.626 --> 00:05:16.849
They reported great results and I know
this was

106
00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.984
really flashy because within two weeks of
this paper appearing,

107
00:05:19.984 --> 00:05:22.663
we had three different groups of MD
Anderson coming to us

108
00:05:22.663 --> 00:05:25.795
in Bioinformatics and saying we want to do
this, help us do this.

109
00:05:25.795 --> 00:05:30.300
And being helpful bioinformaticians we
said sure, we'd love to do that.

110
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.180
And in particular, since all of the data
involved is public, we should be able to

111
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.140
go out and figure out how to do

112
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.730
it ourselves, and generalize it to other
trials.

113
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.480
So okay.

114
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.970
Let's, so let's, let's try that.

115
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.910
And we decided to try that starting with
docetaxel.

116
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.410
So we're, starting with the most sensitive
and most resistant

117
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.230
cell lines.

118
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.620
In this case, we're going to be using U95
A arrays for the NCI60.

119
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.480
And these arrays were run in triplicates,
we've got three for each.

120
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.700
And when we did this, and we tried to fit
the training data,

121
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.710
here is a plot of the first two principle
components of these things.

122
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.910
And what you can see, not too
surprisingly,

123
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.200
is that you have some pretty clear
separation

124
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.980
between all the resistant ones at the
left,

125
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.850
and all the sensitive ones at the right.

126
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.340
This little triangle of three things,
those

127
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.980
are three replicates of the same cell
line.

128
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.860
So that's sort

129
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.080
of what we expect to see.

130
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.220
Now this separation should not surprise
you.

131
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.420
This is the training set.

132
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.300
We have picked the genes specifically to
achieve this separation.

133
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.030
What we now what to see is we now want to
see clinical samples projected

134
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.900
into this same space and see the

135
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.830
separation so that we can use it
ourselves.

136
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.530
So we took the predicted, the actual page

137
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.160
information, and we projected it into the
space.

138
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.030
And we did not see the separation that we
were really hoping and expecting to see.

139
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.990
So of course, this led to the natural
question of, did we do something wrong?

140
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.390
And this is of course, well now we're

141
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.530
going to start to reconstruct exactly what
was done.

142
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.710
And to do this we begin by saying, okay,
well okay, what were

143
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.500
the signatures or the, the specific genes
that they used for the individual drugs?

144
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.020
And this is actually somwhat easy because,
in the supplementary material

145
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.140
to their paper, they included, here are
the

146
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.960
lists for each drug of all the accumetric

147
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.460
proset IDs that are involved and all the
genes that are involved and in, then in

148
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.450
the paper they also gave some exp,
explanations

149
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.330
about Here are some genes that make sense

150
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.290
in the context of this drug, because it
explains the biology and so on, like that.

151
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.350
So, okay.

152
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.610
So we decided to pick one of the drugs,
and we started with 5-Fluorouracil.

153
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.300
And what we want to be able to do with
this, is

154
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.020
we want to be able to construct a heatmap
that looks like this.

155
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.150
This is a heatmap that actually

156
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.120
showed up in the paper.

157
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.030
This is of the 45 genes that they picked
out for 5-Fluorouracil.

158
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.690
And one of the things that you can see is
this plaid pattern

159
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.960
because every one of the 45 genes has a
pattern that we like.

160
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.250
In other words, high in one group and low
in the other, four low then high.

161
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.110
So, okay.

162
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.990
Extreme separation, that's what we expect.
That's what we want in the cell lines.

163
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.940
So, well, how'd they pick these?

164
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.210
Well, they picked these using two sample
t-tests, and I'm a PhD level

165
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.080
statistician so I figured out how to do
two sample t-tests by this point.

166
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.520
So we tried it ourselves.

167
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.700
So here's our best 45 using t-tests.

168
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.050
So okay, great.

169
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.140
And then we said, all right, let's take

170
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.530
the list of affymetrix probeset IDs for
there 45

171
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.280
and take a look at that heatmap, and we

172
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.870
didn't see, again, what we were expecting
to see.

173
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.650
So we then decided to try something which
we've learned to unfortunately do

174
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.260
every once in a while, which is to be just
a bit paranoid about

175
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:17.970
the data.

176
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:24.590
And what we did then was we took our list
and theirs, and we put them side by side.

177
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:29.075
So there's their list and there's ours.
Does anybody notice a pattern here?

178
00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:31.490
[LAUGH]

179
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.460
What we have here is an off by one
indexing error.

180
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.430
This is true for all of the genes in this
signature.

181
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:42.270
Now what does that say to you about
whether or not certain

182
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.630
genes making sense in terms of the
biology, really holds.

183
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:51.170
When they're referencing a set of genes
that actually isn't involved.

184
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.710
So now of course this is just one drug.
They looked at seven.

185
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.250
So there's six others, so what we decided
to

186
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.680
do for these six others was we basically
took

187
00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.110
their reported affymetrix IDs, moved down
one, and looked

188
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.290
at the p.values to see if they're really
small.

189
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.300
So let's see.

190
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.560
Well!
Topo Tico yep, they're all off by one!

191
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.200
And Topo side off by one.
Adriamycin is mostly off by one.

192
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.855
There's a few we can't explain.

193
00:09:11.855 --> 00:09:14.990
Paclitaxel mostly off by one.
Docetaxel mostly off by one.

194
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.730
And Cytoxan we have no earthly idea what
they did with this drug.

195
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.250
So OK, fine.

196
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.480
We've got this, and we know that's one
problem.

197
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.380
Now, how is it that this problem could
arise?

198
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.110
And to answer that one, we went in and

199
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.330
we looked at the software that they were
using.

200
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.570
And as a side note, if you want to read
documentation on how

201
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:33.570
this software works.

202
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.870
You should go to our website, because I
wrote it, because we couldn't find any.

203
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.760
And one of the things that we noted was
that

204
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.200
their software, in order to work, required
two input files.

205
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.950
The first input file is the quantification
matrix, genes by samples and this

206
00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.210
matrix needs a header, where the header is
either zero, one or two.

207
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.450
To indicate that this is a training sample
sensitive, training

208
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.690
sample resistant or a test sample whose
outcome we don't know,

209
00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.940
that's the first input; the quantification
matrix.

210
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.740
The second input is a list of gene IDs,
gene

211
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.120
names in the same order as in the
quantification matrix.

212
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.820
But, for their software to work correctly,
this

213
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.390
second input must not have a header row.

214
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.770
So if you start with an excel file and you
copy and you paste

215
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:22.340
and you've got a title at the top that
says gene name, guess what happens?

216
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:22.790
You will get an

217
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.190
off by one indexing error.

218
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.200
And if you run this through your software
we tried this with Docetaxel and

219
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.650
we perfectly matched the heatmaps and we
also got some of these offset genes.

220
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.760
So we know that works.

221
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.942
But again that's one drug Docetaxel out of
seven so what happens with the other six.

222
00:10:35.942 --> 00:10:37.061
Well, let's take a look.

223
00:10:37.061 --> 00:10:39.590
Okay [UNKNOWN] we can perfectly match the
heatmaps.

224
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:40.920
We know what cell lines are involved.

225
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.310
We know what genes they should be
producing.

226
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.210
Okay, fine.

227
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.400
Adriamycin perfect, Etoposide perfect,
5-FU perfect,

228
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.010
Paclitaxel well, they mislabeled it as

229
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.460
cyclophosphamide in the paper but okay.

230
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.310
And cyclophosphamide we still have no
earthly idea what they did this sheet.

231
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.980
So okay.

232
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.580
There's, There's, There's we can perfectly
match the

233
00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.330
heat maps for six of the seven drugs.

234
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.900
We understand what they did.

235
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.270
Now actually, before we go on, I should
note that this should actually bother you.

236
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.570
And the reason it should bother you is
that we've

237
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.510
perfectly matched the heatmaps for six of
the seven drugs.

238
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.170
But we managed to perfectly match the gene
lists for

239
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.700
only three.

240
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.020
For four of the drugs, there are included

241
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.340
other genes that we can't explain just
yet.

242
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.580
They are outliers.

243
00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.380
And we'll come back to those because
before

244
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.130
we get there, we also noticed in using
their

245
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.940
software that something that was more
important to

246
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.050
us, which was that their software also
gave predictions.

247
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.080
And this is the clinical thing that we're
really interested in.

248
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.820
We want to know, is this patient going to
be sensitive or not.

249
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.540
So, we wanted to see, can we get good
predictions

250
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.760
out of the software.

251
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.210
And the way we're going to check this
well, there's a

252
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.720
bit of a problem in that the paper doesn't
say,

253
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.710
for the fit and data sets that they fit,
this

254
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.380
patient turned out to be sensitive, this
one resistant, no.

255
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.870
They just gave us an overall rate of
accuracy, okay, so that

256
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.950
they got, if they got 24 patients, they
got 22 of them right.

257
00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:56.890
Okay, fine.

258
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.520
So we're going to say that we understand
the classification algorithm or

259
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.920
this thing well enough to use it if we can
get accuracies

260
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.750
at least as good as the ones that they
report, okay?

261
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.800
That's our bar.

262
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.930
So that of course, brings about the next
question, which

263
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.640
is, just how good are the accuracy rates
that they obtain?

264
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.240
So we're going to look at this in the
context of Docetaxel.

265
00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.680
And this top plot is a figure from the
paper and you can see the

266
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.030
scores for the sensitive patient's and
they are

267
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.270
mostly low with blue squares and that's
good.

268
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.870
Resistant ones are high and they've got
red triangles and that's good.

269
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.990
And I have a question here.
I have an analysis

270
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.530
question for the audience.

271
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.430
The analysis question is how many blue
squares are

272
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:39.500
there?
13.

273
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.420
That is correct.

274
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.490
We have up there in the top plot.

275
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.830
13 sensitive samples and 11 resistant
ones.

276
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.220
Now there's a second panel on this page
right here.

277
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.270
The thing is this panel doesn't come from
this paper.

278
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.570
This panel comes from a paper by Chang et
al.

279
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.050
They're the ones that actually introduced
the test set being analyzed here.

280
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.760
And according to Chang et all they thought

281
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.800
that they had 11 sensitive and 13
resistant.

282
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.100
So 13 and 11 or

283
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.130
11 and 13.

284
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.830
That may be a problem so we decided to
take a look at a different drug.

285
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.770
Namely Adriamycin and for those of you who
are real math whizzes here.

286
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:13.880
How many red triangles are there?

287
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:15.470
Okay?

288
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:16.930
For those who are not quite that
ambitious,

289
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.540
are there more red triangles or blue
squares?

290
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.830
Come on.
This is not a trick question.

291
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.780
I hear red triangles are what.

292
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.890
So basically we've got a whole bunch of
patients that are resistant to therapy.

293
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.230
The problem is, in this case, the
underlying dataset that's applied

294
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.790
to this thing, this was from a paper on
childhood leukemia.

295
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:37.810
The reason this is a problem is that
childhood leukemia is a

296
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.000
disease for which we've actually got a
pretty good cure rate, around 80%.

297
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.940
And what that means, is that if we've got
a drug to

298
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:47.180
which most of the patients are resistant,
which wouldn't be using it.

299
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.200
And indeed, if we go

300
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.150
back to the original paper that submitted
it,

301
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.480
they thought that most of their patients
were sensitive.

302
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.670
So what do we think is going on?

303
00:13:55.670 --> 00:14:00.210
We think, that for zero and one, they
swapped the interpretation in

304
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.110
feeding it into the data and they didn't
realize what they were doing.

305
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.780
Now, what does this mean clinically?

306
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.740
It means that what, well, their going to
use that signature, and they're going

307
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:12.750
to use Adriamycin just for the patients
who will derive no benefit from it.

308
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.870
This is poor clinical practice.

309
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.180
So, we don't think this is a good idea.

310
00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.060
So, given this there is the question of,
okay, if they're mixing things up

311
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.030
this badly, how is it that they're getting
good predictions in the first place?

312
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.670
And actually, this leads back to one of
the things that we passed

313
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:29.330
on just a few minutes ago which is that
there were some other genes.

314
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.560
And in particular, for docetaxel, there
were 50 genes.

315
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.760
If we take our list of Docetaxel and we do

316
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.080
this off by one trick, we match 31 that
leaves 19.

317
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.150
Of these 19,

318
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.610
there's the question of where can they
come from?

319
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.390
Well, if you go back to the initial paper
by Chang et al that supplied the test set.

320
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.430
They say if you want to separate R
resistance from R

321
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.600
sensitives, here's a list of 92 genes
that'll do the job.

322
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.280
So we said, okay, let's take a look at the
19 we can't match and compare them

323
00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.760
with the 92 they report and we find out
that there is an overlap of 14 genes.

324
00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.480
There you go, they are entries 7 through
20 in this list, one contiguous block.

325
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.330
I think we have some statisticians in the
audience, so quick question.

326
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.940
If I pick 14 items at random from a list
with 92 in

327
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.260
it, how often do they all, all appear
right next to each other?

328
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.570
The p value is small, you can get
published with this one.

329
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.640
okay, now of course, this still leaves
five.

330
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.540
What are the other five?

331
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.980
Well, they're ERCC1, ERCC4, ERBB2,
BCL2L11, and TUBA3.

332
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.100
The thing that kind, that, the common
theme of these five is

333
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.730
that these are the genes mentioned by name
in the paper to explain

334
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.630
why the signature works.

335
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.160
So for the docetaxel signature we have the
genes

336
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.760
that work to split the test set, the genes

337
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.160
that work to split the training set, and
the

338
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.990
genes that are there to explain why it
works.

339
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:41.710
And there is no overlap between these
three.

340
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.580
We thought this was somewhat disturbing.

341
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.910
So we wrote a letter to Nature Medicine.

342
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.220
And one of the things about this being a
talk on reproducible

343
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.450
research, is that you don't have to take
my word for it.

344
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.820
Which means that you can go to Nature
Medicine, you can read

345
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.370
the paper.

346
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:59.160
You can also read our reports, which
contain all of our code.

347
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.110
You can run it through R, and you will get
the same numbers we do.

348
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:06.480
As a side note for data compression our
note to nature medicine is 700 words.

349
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.790
There's 140 pages of supplementary
material for those 700 words there.

350
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.420
So there's a bit of a compression there.

351
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.150
So that one's fun.
And so all the data's there.

352
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.500
And then of course we waited to see okay
is there a response.

353
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.620
So they say oh well whoops we got it
wrong.

354
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.360
We'll fix it next time.

355
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.190
Well no that wasn't quite the response.

356
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.670
The response was well, unfortunately the
analysis of Baggerly

357
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.710
and Coombes is deeply flawed and amongst
other errors.

358
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.010
Well, first off for adriamycin the labels,
this is

359
00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.980
the one where they have a lot of red
triangles.

360
00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.320
The labels are actually correct.

361
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.370
And we've posted details on our website to
illustrate this.

362
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.250
And they must be wrong because we've
gotten this approach to work

363
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.770
again and in their rebuttal they note that
they've done it twice.

364
00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.840
In new papers with editorials and things
like that.

365
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.270
So we must have

366
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.300
screwed up.

367
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.480
And well given the timing I'm not going to
be

368
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.910
able to go through all of these but I want

369
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.470
to look at some of the data for one or

370
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.200
two of these just to illustrate what might
be going on.

371
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.190
So let's start with Adriamycin.

372
00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.610
For Adriamycin they say they've got the
labels correct on their website.

373
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.030
So we went to their webpage and we said
what's there?

374
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.860
Well actually, when we went there we saw

375
00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.890
that there's a table of quantification for
144 samples.

376
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.460
22 for training

377
00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.120
cell lines, and 122 for test.

378
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.640
These are the patient ones, for which
they're making predictions.

379
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.250
And we said, well, maybe we can find
something that separates the

380
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.960
responders from the non-responders, so we
decide, let's try to cluster it.

381
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.720
And as a prelude to that, let's just

382
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.830
check the correlations between individual
pairs of elements.

383
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:29.450
And what I'm going to show you now, is a
plot of

384
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:34.280
all the really high correlations we see in
this matrix of 144 samples.

385
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.510
Here's the sub-matrix corresponding to the

386
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.560
training data, the cell lines.
And here's the test data.

387
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.780
Now the red line on the main diagonal we
expected.

388
00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.830
Samples are indeed highly correlated with
themselves, that's good.

389
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:51.390
However, we didn't expect these red dots
off the main diagonal.

390
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:52.500
What's going on?

391
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:59.130
Well, turns out they have 122 test
samples, but the 122 are not all distinct.

392
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.160
There are some samples that they have
reused two,

393
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.970
three, or even four times.

394
00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:07.130
And there's a sample right about here
which has been reused four

395
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.540
times which has been labeled as resistant
three times out of four.

396
00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.660
Now that's the same sample.

397
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:17.560
So we're pretty pretty convinced that the
labels are not all correct even now.

398
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.620
So we set a further note to Nature
Medicine about

399
00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.140
this and Nature Medicine forwarded this on
to the authors.

400
00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.460
And then they got back to us and said well

401
00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.690
they'll adjust it so we see no publish
your note.

402
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.330
Okay, fine and,

403
00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.020
indeed, what they said later in August of'
08, was that

404
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.730
they had redone the analysis using only
the 95 unique samples.

405
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.700
And they had, again, gotten great results.

406
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.850
Now, for those of you were listening to me
carefully before, you

407
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:42.180
will recall that I said that there were
actually 84 distinct samples.

408
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.020
So hearing that there were 95 was a bit of
a surprise to us.

409
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.250
So, okay, but fine.
And what'd they do now?

410
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.700
Well, when they corrected this in August
08, they actually

411
00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.300
took down the quantifications and they
just put up a list.

412
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.409
Of the 95 geo

413
00:18:53.409 --> 00:18:54.680
IDs of the areas involved.

414
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.730
So, lemme show you the first 20 of the 95
they now list.

415
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.393
And I've highlighted a few of them,
because that used twice,

416
00:19:05.393 --> 00:19:09.026
that used twice, this one used twice and
labeled both ways.

417
00:19:09.026 --> 00:19:11.875
So actually, of the 95, which is, the is

418
00:19:11.875 --> 00:19:16.167
the second correction, by the way, 15 are
in duplicate.

419
00:19:16.167 --> 00:19:19.825
Of those 15, 16, six are labeled both ways
and furthermore since

420
00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:24.027
they've actually note, now told us the Geo
I.D.s of the individual arrays.

421
00:19:24.027 --> 00:19:26.667
We can actually go back and figure out
what the initial submitters

422
00:19:26.667 --> 00:19:29.520
thought they were, in terms of resistant
or sensitive.

423
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.990
So, the group, the dup group says that 61

424
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:35.620
are resistant, 13 are sensitive, and six
we don't know.

425
00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.520
The people submitting the data thought
that 22 were

426
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.940
resistant, 48 were sensitive, and 10 they
labeled as intermediate.

427
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.640
They didn't classify them.

428
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.130
So for Adriamycin, we're not convinced
this works.

429
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.410
Well, all right, there's still other
things that they put out there.

430
00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:49.750
There's other papers with editorials.

431
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:51.780
So let me show you one of those.
This is a paper

432
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.720
that showed up in the Journal of Clinical
Oncology, by Hsu et al.

433
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.510
And in this paper, they extended the
approach

434
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.900
to deal with two new drugs, Cisplatin and
Pemetrexed.

435
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.100
These are important in treating lung
cancer.

436
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.150
And one of the things that they thought
was really neat was

437
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.090
that they said, okay we actually don't
like the NCI60 for all drugs.

438
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.640
So we're going to shift to a different set
of cell

439
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.560
lines and these cell lines were profiled
on Affy U133 Arrays.

440
00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.900
And one of the things that they did using

441
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.750
this, was they came up with a signature
for Cisplatin.

442
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.950
For Cisplatin, they pointed out something
important.

443
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.460
Specifically that the signature they found

444
00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.310
contained ERCC1, ERCC4 and DNA repair
genes.

445
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.530
That's important because there have been
several papers in the New

446
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.450
England Journal saying these are related
to how you treat lung cancer.

447
00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.570
So, that's really cool.
So what'd we do?

448
00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.530
Well, we took the data and we said all
right let's try to see if we

449
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.290
can match the heatmaps so we know the cell
lines and the, and the genes involved.

450
00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:40.730
And after with some work and that's
another compression thing there.

451
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.400
We did manage to exactly

452
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.820
match the heatmaps.

453
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.960
And for Cisplatin, after we exactly
matched the heatmap, we

454
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.860
took a look at the genes involved and we
discovered that

455
00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:54.400
we could match 41 of the 45 genes they
report

456
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.290
after accounting for this off by one error
that's still there.

457
00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:58.530
There's four that we can't match at all.

458
00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.345
Do I have any guesses from the audience as
to the identities of those four?

459
00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:06.290
[LAUGH] The four that we cannot match are

460
00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:11.720
ERCC1, ERCC4, ERCC1 again, and FANCM, and
of these four, the last two are special.

461
00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:17.230
Because as it turns out, those two aren't
on the U133A arrays, they're on the U133B.

462
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.690
So two of their best genes they haven't
measured yet, but

463
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.440
hey, who needs to conduct experiments if
you know the answer?

464
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.540
This is a wonderful finding.

465
00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.380
Okay, great.
so, we were disturbed by this.

466
00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.150
As a side note, we submitted a correction
for this one to JCO,

467
00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.510
and they sent us a note back saying we're
sorry, we can't publish this.

468
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.580
And we said okay fine.

469
00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.150
And over the next few years what went on
from there

470
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.570
is that there were other papers that kept
on coming 07,08,09.

471
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:45.390
But middle of last year, we learned
something new

472
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.220
that sort of disturbed us and what we
learned middle

473
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.170
of last year was that they'd already
started running clinical

474
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.820
trials using these rules to allocate
patients to treatment arms.

475
00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.020
They're doing this using pemetrexed versus
cisplatin, pemetrexed

476
00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.880
vinorelbine, docetaxel and doxorubicin.

477
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.270
And for several of these drugs, these are
in cases

478
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:03.750
where the posted signatures, they've

479
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.081
gotten the sensitivin resistant labels
reversed.

480
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.810
So we think this is a problem.
So we wrote up a paper on this.

481
00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.770
We first circulated it to a biological
journal and got the comment

482
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.845
back that we're sorry, this story seems
too negative, can you fix that?

483
00:22:16.845 --> 00:22:17.660
[LAUGH].

484
00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.740
At which point we said well, we probably
can't.

485
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.730
So we sent it off to the Annals of Applied
Statistics

486
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:23.870
on the first of September.

487
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.640
It was accepted and published online by
the fourteenth.

488
00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.420
At which point was covered by the press,
Duke starts an

489
00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.380
internal investigation and suspended the
trials

490
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.910
pending the outcome of the investigation.

491
00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:35.430
That was October of last year.
So what happened next?

492
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:42.930
As of the end of January of this year,
Duke decided to restart the trials.

493
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:46.520
And in particular, they said that their
investigation, which was now concluded,

494
00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.540
had strengthened their confidence in this

495
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.220
evolving approach to personalized cancer
treatment.

496
00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.850
Now, we were not really pleased by this.

497
00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.200
And the main reason we were not really
pleased is

498
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.330
that we asked them well, okay, we don't
understand the data.

499
00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:03.300
Can you show us the data and stuff you
used to reach

500
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.280
this conclusion.
And they said well, no.

501
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.580
While the reviewers that conducted these
things approved of our sharing our

502
00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.440
report with the National Cancer Institute,
we consider it a confidential document.

503
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.480
So, no, you can't see it.

504
00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:20.860
Which disturbed us, and, as a side note,
there's just one more thing.

505
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:27.450
Which is, that this investigation took
place between October and January.

506
00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:28.520
Well as it happens in

507
00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.470
November, something new happened.

508
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:35.280
In November they posted data, they posted
new data for one paper for dealing

509
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.920
with cisplatin and pemetrexed; these are
two

510
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.870
of the drugs they're using in clinical
trials.

511
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:42.240
And in this data, they said here are the
59 samples

512
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.970
that we're using as a validation set, to
show that this works.

513
00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:47.440
These 59 samples are a subset of this one

514
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.340
geo dataset and we're using it to make
predictions.

515
00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.810
So we said okay, cool.
We see these 59 samples.

516
00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:54.000
We've got the ovarian ones.

517
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.340
Lets go in and take a look at them.

518
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:59.132
So the very first thing we did with these
59 samples we said lets go back to the

519
00:23:59.132 --> 00:24:03.190
geo dataset and see if we can match them
up and when we did here's what we found.

520
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:08.560
So what, if the names matched up for all
the 59 samples

521
00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.610
we should see 59 red squares lying on this
blue diagonal line.

522
00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:14.820
How many red squares do you see lying on
that blue diagonal line?

523
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.305
This is not a heart pounding question.

524
00:24:18.305 --> 00:24:20.110
[LAUGH].
None.

525
00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:24.040
43 of the samples they got the labels
wrong.

526
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.180
For 16 they didn't get the labels wrong or
at

527
00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.760
least, the problem is for these 16, we
can't tell.

528
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.440
The reason we can't tell is that for those
16, they've scrambled the

529
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.530
gene labels so badly that we don't know
what samples they correspond to.

530
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:39.270
What this means is that for their
validation data set, every single sample

531
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:43.590
is incorrect for two drugs they've been
using in clinical trials for two years.

532
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:48.680
We think this is disturbing.
So what happened next?

533
00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.990
We pointed this out at the end of January.
No response.

534
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:55.990
So we then said, can we do anything else?

535
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.230
And it occurred to us that they said,
well, we won't show

536
00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:02.400
you the report But the reviewers approved
us sending it the NCI.

537
00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.000
Now the NCI in the US, is a federally
funded institution

538
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.120
and what that means is that they are
subject to Federal law,

539
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.930
specifically the Freedom of Information
Act.

540
00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:18.540
So, in April we filed a request with the
NCI to get the report under the Freedom

541
00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.050
of Information Act and the start of May

542
00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:24.170
a redacted version of the report was
indeed supplied.

543
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.200
And we looked at it and we found a few
things

544
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.930
that were rather interesting in the report
or weren't in the report.

545
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.510
The two main things that we found were
that first off

546
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.380
the review committee that went through
this stuff the people who evaluated

547
00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.310
it said by the way we couldn't figure out
from

548
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.820
the data that has been published how to do
this.

549
00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.310
The only way we got it was because there
was extra information

550
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:46.790
supplied to us and we really recommend the
investigators make that public.

551
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:47.750
So that's one thing.

552
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:48.850
The other thing that we found rather

553
00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.470
disturbing was what wasn't there,
specifically, this report

554
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.890
makes no mention of those problems with
cisplatin

555
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:55.930
and pemetrexed that I just told you about.

556
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.000
It's not there.

557
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.370
So we pointed this out in May, and also in
May, we asked the

558
00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:03.000
National Cancer Institute, what do you
think about what's going on?

559
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.880
And well, they said, let's look at the
trials.

560
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.880
We actually don't fund those three clin,
clinical trials.

561
00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.500
We do fund another one that's a phase
three.

562
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.015
And actually based on that they

563
00:26:10.015 --> 00:26:12.560
re-investigated the rationale and they
yanked that

564
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.870
signature form the phase three clinical
trial in the middle of the trial.

565
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.300
That's mid-May.

566
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.010
We said okay, is there anything further
that's going to

567
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.410
happen with these, with the three ongoing
trials at Duke?

568
00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:22.920
Nothing happened.

569
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.566
Nothing happened for two more months and
then in mid-July

570
00:26:25.566 --> 00:26:27.160
we found out something new.

571
00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.190
That's a bit orthogonal from your normal
statistics.

572
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.270
One of the PIs used to claim he was a
Rhodes Scholar.

573
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.300
The Rhodes Trust, in Britain, says no, no
he wasn't.

574
00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:43.490
So indeed, it appears there was some CV
fudging involved.

575
00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:46.780
Now, what happened then was, I knew there
were a few statisticians

576
00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.800
who's been talking about saying, maybe we
should write a letter or something.

577
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.680
So, I emailed a few of them, the day this
came out and said,

578
00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.830
you know, if you want to write a letter,
now's about the best time.

579
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:56.900
So, the following

580
00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.810
Monday, three days later, there is a
letter from

581
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.330
31, 33 biostatisticians find a few that
you like.

582
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:07.540
And the cancer letter comments that Duke's
administrators have accomplished

583
00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.090
something monumental, they triggered a

584
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.244
public expression of outrage from
biostatisticians.

585
00:27:11.244 --> 00:27:12.880
[LAUGH] Who, cool.

586
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.310
But the fun thing about this letter was

587
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.770
that it went to the newly appointed head
of

588
00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:18.970
the National Cancerous Institute, Harold
Varmus and to

589
00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.370
Duke and to the DoD, and to the press.

590
00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:21.810
So,

591
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.090
this one got some coverage.
So what happened then?

592
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:26.370
Duke suspended the trials.

593
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.970
This has since been covered, just a bit,
in a few other

594
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.240
outlets like NPR, Science, Nature, and
some other fly by night journals.

595
00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.600
And a few other investigations are under
way.

596
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.690
And there's actually a new Google group
devoted

597
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.240
entirely to reproducible research and
things like that.

598
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.680
But, as we've been looking at this, there
is

599
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.850
a caveat that I think we should keep in
mind.

600
00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:46.920
And that caveat is that

601
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.160
unfortunately, some of these mistakes,
like the off by one.

602
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.690
We've seen them before.

603
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:52.660
This is not the only time.

604
00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:56.470
We've seen some of these examples going
back to 2002, 2003, 2005.

605
00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:00.340
These types of errors have been around for
awhile.

606
00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:04.120
This is an egregious combination But the
problems are there.

607
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.210
So some observations.

608
00:28:07.202 --> 00:28:10.110
The most common mistakes are simple ones.

609
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:12.210
For example, in statistics, the simplest
one here

610
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.960
for genomics is complete confounding of
the experimental design.

611
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.680
Others involve, mixing up sample labels,
gene labels,

612
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.140
things that are easy to do in excel, okay.

613
00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.660
Those are easy to mistake.

614
00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:26.780
Now the fun thing about simple mistakes is
that if you see them, they're easy to fix.

615
00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:30.570
But if the documentation is poor, you
won't see them.

616
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:34.310
So they will slip by, because our
intuition is no good.

617
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:37.240
And what that means, is that if you go out
to the literature,

618
00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.040
we sort of suspect, yet the most simple
mistakes

619
00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.680
are more common than we would like to
admit.

620
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.650
Now what would we like to have happen?

621
00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:49.260
Well, for papers we've got a little thing
of saying here's some things we

622
00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.100
really would like to see in addition to
data like the stuff at geo.

623
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.710
We'd really like some idea of if you're
going to

624
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:57.770
supply us with a table of qualifications,
please label the columns.

625
00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:01.750
Tell us which samples are which and
provide code.

626
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:02.300
So these are some

627
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:02.770
other things.

628
00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:05.870
And these are recommendations for papers,
but we think

629
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.660
they should be absolute requirements
before you start clinical trials.

630
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.940
Now, do we as the phrase goes, walk the
walk?

631
00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.240
What do we do?

632
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:22.310
Well, partially in response to this, about
in early 2007, Kevin Coombes and I

633
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:26.540
went into our Department of Bioinformatics
at MD Anderson and we said, guess what?

634
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.440
Henceforth we

635
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.150
are announcing, by fiat, that all reports
that we write are

636
00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.980
now going to be written in Sweave
combination of R and LaTeX.

637
00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.350
The fun thing about Sweave is that you can
take these reports, you can run

638
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:43.160
them through R, somebody else can run them
through R and get the same numbers.

639
00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.890
As a side note, most of our reports now

640
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.890
go, are written by stat analyst, faculty
member teams.

641
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.070
The analyst writes the report, submits it
to the faculty member.

642
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:51.780
The faculty member proofreads it.

643
00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.650
Reruns the code

644
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.860
if necessary, and only after the second
approval

645
00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.210
does it go off to the biological PI.

646
00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.430
This has actually helped our
reproducibility, quite a bit.

647
00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:01.740
So actually, if you ask us what we did in
any report

648
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.370
going back for about three years now, we
can tell you exactly.

649
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:05.990
We find that useful.

650
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:09.760
But the buzz phrase in all of this is
reproducible research.

651
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.230
Now, so, I've given you some observations
and

652
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:13.740
I've told you lessons that I really want
you

653
00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.310
to derive from it, so I have one

654
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.940
last slide and that is to acknowledge some
folks.

655
00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.760
So, Kevin Coombes is my primary co-author
in all of these things.

656
00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.390
Some other folks at MD Anderson, the

657
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:24.830
various groups that provided money at MD
Anderson.

658
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.970
And, of course, if you want to read more,
you can go to the

659
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.720
Annals of Applied Statistics and you can
read the paper, you can look at

660
00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.350
the code, even better, you can site the
paper because that will make me

661
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:36.178
famous and my mom happy and she can buy
more [UNKNOWN] ties for Christmas.

662
00:30:36.178 --> 00:30:39.730
And I have one last acknowledgement which
is to you, my kind audience for bearing

663
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:46.530
with me for the past half hour, and that's

664
00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:47.085
what I got.
Thank you.

665
00:30:47.085 --> 00:30:48.400
[SOUND].
>> Thank you very much.
