00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.800
This Reproducible Research Case Study
involves trying to

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.170
identify the harmful elements of
particulate matter air pollution.

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.360
So, one thing that you have to understand
is that when you

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.510
look at air pollution in particular if you
look at particulate matter pollution.

5
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.150
The particles are just, you know, the, you

6
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.100
can feel them it's just dust that you
inhale.

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.800
But the dust is not just one monolithic
piece of you know, of dirt or soot.

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.430
It's actually composed of many different
chemical constituents.

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.850
Metals inert things like salts and other
kinds of components.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.458
And so, there's a thought that, you know,
that one possibility is that,

11
00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:41.898
is that a sub, subset of

12
00:00:41.898 --> 00:00:45.246
those constituents are the really harmful
elements.

13
00:00:45.246 --> 00:00:50.054
And if we could figure out which one of
those subsets are, are harmful.

14
00:00:50.054 --> 00:00:51.301
Then we could think about trying to

15
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:54.250
regulate the sources that generate those
chemical instituents.

16
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.480
Now it's very hard to do this and the,

17
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.530
the research involved in this area is
still fairly preliminary.

18
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.220
But so but so there's a lot of interest in

19
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.640
trying to identify the harmful chemical
constituents of particulate matter.

20
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.840
Because in theory, that could lead us

21
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.010
to targeting or tailoring things like
regulations.

22
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.890
That can that can that can control the
sources of

23
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.049
air pollution that are the most harmful to
human health.

24
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.430
PM is composed of many different chemical
constituents.

25
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.200
And it's important to understand actually
that the EPA, or the

26
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.570
Environmental Protection Agency, monitors
the chemical

27
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.070
constituents of particulate matter on a.

28
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.200
And has been doing so since roughly 1999
or 2000 on a national basis.

29
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.810
and, and there's a general understanding
that, perhaps, some of

30
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.800
the components of PM might be more harmful
than others.

31
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.139
And if that were true, that would, prob,
that would likely

32
00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:50.455
imply that some sources of particulate
matter are more dangerous than others.

33
00:01:50.455 --> 00:01:52.527
Because some sources of particulate matter

34
00:01:52.527 --> 00:01:55.760
generate certain combinations of chemical
constituents.

35
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.850
And some sources generate other com,
combinations of chemical constituents.

36
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.220
And so the idea is that we can, if we

37
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.840
can identify the particularly harmful

38
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.280
chemical constituents of particulate
matter.

39
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.060
Then that may lead us to strategies for,
to better

40
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.790
strategies for controlling sources of, the
sources of particulate matter.

41
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.446
One thing that you need to understand is
the

42
00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:16.888
way that particulate matter is regulated
or controlled now.

43
00:02:16.888 --> 00:02:19.228
Is we just regulate, our, the total amount
of

44
00:02:19.228 --> 00:02:21.802
power, the total amount of particles in
the air.

45
00:02:21.802 --> 00:02:25.729
Without regard to where the sources of p,
of PM what

46
00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:29.057
the sources of PM are or where they are
coming from.

47
00:02:29.057 --> 00:02:31.710
And so if, if we can do, and, and, and so
this

48
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.950
strategy is, it does help them pro, has,
doesn't improve public health.

49
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.996
Because know that particular manner, as a
whole, is harmful.

50
00:02:38.996 --> 00:02:41.696
But it doesn't perhaps lead to the most
efficient strategy

51
00:02:41.696 --> 00:02:44.589
and the most helpful strategy in terms of
public health.

52
00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:48.117
Because we don't, we don't control things
with respect to which

53
00:02:48.117 --> 00:02:52.210
toxic elements are the most, are, which
elements are the most toxic.

54
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.018
So, I just want to talk about one
particular study and

55
00:02:57.018 --> 00:03:00.821
one examp, one case study of, of this type
of research.

56
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:02.555
And how, and I'll talk a little bit more

57
00:03:02.555 --> 00:03:05.450
how it relates to reproducibility in a few
slides.

58
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.340
But the basis of this case study is, is
the

59
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.010
National Morbidity Mortality and Air
Pollution study or the NMMAPS study.

60
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.460
And this was a national study of the

61
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.410
short term health effects of ambient air
pollution.

62
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.078
So this parti-, this particular national
study

63
00:03:19.078 --> 00:03:21.472
focused on particulate matter or PM 10.

64
00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:26.290
So this is particles less than 10 microns
in diameter and ozone.

65
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.330
So for this partic, this lecture I'm just
going to talk about PM 10.

66
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.490
The health outcomes in the study were
mortality from

67
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.180
all causes and hospitalization for
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.

68
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.120
So I've got some links to some of the key
publications from the NMMAPS study.

69
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.549
And and, and this entire study was fu, was
funded by the Health Effects Institute.

70
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.310
One of the interesting aspects of the
NMMAPS study was that it

71
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.290
was, it was one of the most reproducible
air pollution studies ever conducted.

72
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.800
In particular, the investigators in N, the
original investigators in NMMAPS decided

73
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.360
to make the data and, the results and the
software code available.

74
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.330
Through, a website called the internet
based

75
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.560
health and air pollution surveillance
system or iHAPSS.

76
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.970
And so on that website you can find the
air

77
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.204
pollution data, the, the weather data, the
software, the results.

78
00:04:16.204 --> 00:04:20.100
And many other things, on that can be
downloaded for free.

79
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.650
Since the data have been made available

80
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.580
to the public many studies have been
conducted.

81
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.580
Based on this data that were independent
of the original NMMAPS.

82
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.579
So one particular study counted over 67

83
00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:37.010
publish, publications based on the NMMAPS
data.

84
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.665
So the data and the code that have been
made available to the public.

85
00:04:39.665 --> 00:04:41.570
That has served as an important test

86
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.140
bed for methodological development in this
area.

87
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.780
So one recent study that was published in
the journal Environmental

88
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.390
Health Perspectus involved the cardio,
cardiovascular

89
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.850
effects of nickel in the air.

90
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.090
So, nickel is a common component of
particulate matter.

91
00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.740
It's a transition metal.

92
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.820
And it's thought to be very harmful and,

93
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.810
and in particular, cause cardiovascular
types of effects.

94
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.310
And so, this study found partic, they
found strong evidence that nickel in

95
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.000
particulate matter modified the short term
effect of PM 10 across 60 US communities.

96
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.070
So basically what this is saying is that
what they found is that in communities

97
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.290
where the particulate matter had a larger
concentration

98
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.470
of nickel in it, relative to other
elements.

99
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.280
That those communities saw kind of worse
health risks from PM 10

100
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.490
than other, than other communities that
had kind of less nickel in them.

101
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.480
So the idea is.

102
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.570
So, the, the inference that one might draw
from that is that

103
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.950
nickel is a one or maybe the only toxic
element in PM 10.

104
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.520
And if your particles are composed of more
nickel

105
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.690
then they are going to be more harmful to
you.

106
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.220
So that the, the evidence that they
brought in this paper,

107
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.960
or a part of the evidence that they
brought in this paper.

108
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.180
When they look at other chemical
constituents of particulate

109
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.850
matter, it didn't seem to have this same
modifying effect.

110
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.560
So if you looked at for example two
cities, in

111
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.898
where one city had much higher
concentrations of sulfate for example.

112
00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:08.830
That did not lead to greater health risks.

113
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.500
The, compared to a city that had lower
concentrations of sulfate.

114
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.880
So, the main, one of the main modifying
effects came from this nickel element.

115
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.650
And so the result was very attractive
because it seemed to identify one or just

116
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.500
a few elements as, that, that led to the
kind of higher health risks of PM 10.

117
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.800
And so it's almost like there was a single
element that

118
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.950
needed to be, or, or just a very small
number of elements.

119
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.740
That could be regulated or controlled.

120
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.590
And so there is one, so there is a thought

121
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.862
that, you know, perhaps this was too
simple to be true.

122
00:06:39.862 --> 00:06:43.489
So Francesca Dominici and myself and some

123
00:06:43.489 --> 00:06:47.568
colleagues decided to look at the data
again.

124
00:06:47.568 --> 00:06:51.648
And see you know what was driving the
association between

125
00:06:51.648 --> 00:06:56.790
PM 10 risk and Nickel and another
transition metal called vanadium.

126
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.520
So we looked at the data, we re-examined
it

127
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.500
NMMAPS data and linked it with PM chemical
constituent data.

128
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.680
And one particular thought that we had was
one of the cities in

129
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.020
the U.S. that has extremely high levels of
nickel, is New York City.

130
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.550
And so, there's one possibility is that
because

131
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.880
New York City has such very high levels.

132
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.080
Would the results of such an analysis be
driven

133
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.540
by the high levels of nickel in New York
City?

134
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.480
So here's a simple scatter plot.

135
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.155
On the x-axis, we have the

136
00:07:28.155 --> 00:07:31.110
long-term average nickel concentrations in
a community.

137
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:35.566
And on the x, on the y-axis, we have the,
essentially, the risk.

138
00:07:35.566 --> 00:07:37.739
The percentage change, the percent
increase in

139
00:07:37.739 --> 00:07:40.260
mortality for a unit increase in
particulate matter.

140
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.120
So you can think of this as the
particulate matter risk of mortality.

141
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.510
And one of the things that you might
notice

142
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.410
is that there does appear to be, a
correlation.

143
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.120
Between long term average nickel
concentrations

144
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.970
in a community and their PM risk.

145
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.900
In the sense that in the scatter plot if
you go

146
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.700
to the right there's, the risk seems to
increase a little bit.

147
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.510
Now on the other hand, one of the other
things you might see

148
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.960
in this plot is that there are, there
appear to be some outliers.

149
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.790
In the, on the right-hand side of the
plot.

150
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.740
There is three or few points that are

151
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.640
very highly they are kind of skewed to the
right.

152
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.580
And so, one, and, and it turns out that
the

153
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.900
three right most points are all counties
in New York City.

154
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.100
So New York City is composed of five
counties.

155
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.090
And so the three that are kind of the
right most

156
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.030
point of the plot are three counties in
New York City.

157
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.980
So, here is the regression line that you
can fit to this data.

158
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.300
It's a simple linear regression line and
you can see that it's positively sloped.

159
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.340
Indiciating a positive correlation so that
more nickel is

160
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.460
associated with a greater risk of
mortality from PM.

161
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.590
And in their original paper their
regression line was

162
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.750
statistically significant with a p value
of less than 0.01.

163
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:53.920
And so that's very interesting.

164
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.230
It would seem to imply that in communities
with

165
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.590
higher nickel concentrations you have
greater risk of mortality.

166
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:07.600
However, if you just remove the kind of
outlying points, in particular

167
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.920
the points that are asso, that are in New
York City.

168
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.750
Which has very high nickel levels, and you
redo the regression line.

169
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.340
You'll see that the blue line is what you
get.

170
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.970
And one of the important things about
those three points

171
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.190
to the right is those are called high
leverage points.

172
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.530
And so the regression line can be very
sensitive to high leverage points.

173
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.540
And so just removing three of them out of
this data

174
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.150
set can bring the bl-, the regression line
down a little bit.

175
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.390
So that you get the blue line, and that
it's no longer statistically significant.

176
00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.520
And in this case, the p-value's about
0.31.

177
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.860
And so one of the things that you can see
is that just a

178
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.300
few points can make a big difference when
looking at a correlation like this.

179
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.490
On every analysis that we did, as we went
through,

180
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.330
and and recomputed the, the slope of the
regression line.

181
00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:01.180
When you when you removed an individual
country or a community in this study.

182
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.290
So remember, there were 60 communities in
the original.

183
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.570
So what we did is we just went through

184
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:08.380
each and just redid the analysis by
removing one community.

185
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.000
Just to see if there were any particular

186
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.120
communities that the analysis was part,
was sensitive to.

187
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.705
And you can see that all the black dots
here represent the

188
00:10:16.705 --> 00:10:19.990
kind of slopes of the regression line when
you remove a given community.

189
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.300
And because they're all kind of clustered
around the same value.

190
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.248
You can see that for the most part the
regression line

191
00:10:25.248 --> 00:10:29.746
is not sensitive to removing any
individual community from the data set.

192
00:10:29.746 --> 00:10:33.376
However, the red dot and red line at the
very bottom indicates the

193
00:10:33.376 --> 00:10:35.356
kind of slope estimate and the 95%

194
00:10:35.356 --> 00:10:38.117
confidence interval when you remove New
York.

195
00:10:38.117 --> 00:10:40.925
And you can see that when you remove the
community of New York

196
00:10:40.925 --> 00:10:44.279
slope estimate goes down quite a bit and
the confidence intervals goes up.

197
00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:47.760
It gets quite a bit wider than all of the
other dots.

198
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.530
And so, that's another indication that the
slope

199
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.670
estimate of that regression line is very
sensitive.

200
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.250
To the kic, just having the data points
from New York City in there.

201
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.610
So in this analysis that we published
again in Environmental

202
00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.780
Health Perspectives there are a couple
things that we learned.

203
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.250
First of all we did confirm that New York
does have very high

204
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:14.440
levels of nickel and vinadium Much higher
than pretty much any other U.S. community.

205
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.770
And that there's evidence of a positive

206
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.510
relationship between nickel concentrations
and PM risk.

207
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.470
Even if you remove the data from New York
City the relationship is still positive.

208
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.320
However, the strength of this relationship
is highly

209
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.880
sensitive to the observations from a
single city.

210
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.970
And so the idea is that the evidence that
you can bring

211
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.870
from the data, is really dependent on just
a few data points.

212
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.880
And so it's important to realize that
although the, we still

213
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:44.740
see this positive association between
nickle and PM risk of mortality.

214
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.650
The strength of the, the, the key, the key
conclusion that you might draw from this

215
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.610
reanalysis is that the strength of the
evidence

216
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.760
is perhaps not as strong as you would
like.

217
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.720
Due to the kind of very sensitive nature
of the,

218
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.460
of this, of the evidence to a single
community.

219
00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.060
So, some of the lessons that we learned
from this case study are that,

220
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.610
is that the reproducibility of the end map
study from the, from the very beginning.

221
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:12.100
First of all it allowed for the secondary,
the original secondary analysis to occur.

222
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.350
To investigate this novel hypothesis that
nickel

223
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.030
is a harmful chemical constituent of PM.

224
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.010
So that's very good and the idea is that

225
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.689
it allowed other people to kind of explore
new ideas.

226
00:12:22.689 --> 00:12:29.180
And so, the paper by Lipman et al is one
example of kind of secondary analysis.

227
00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.120
The reproducibility of the study of course
allowed critique of this new analysis.

228
00:12:34.214 --> 00:12:37.870
And to the and bring to the table
additional new analysis.

229
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.060
That was published by Dominici et al.

230
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.300
And so one of the lessons that we learned
from this paper of

231
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.060
course is that the original hypothesis

232
00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.860
that Nicolas [UNKNOWN] was not really
invalidated.

233
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.120
But merely that the evidence that was
originally

234
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.150
presented is perhaps not as strong as
originally suggested.

235
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.390
And that more work needs to be done to
investigate this hypothesis.

236
00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.514
So one of the other important lessons
learned from this case study.

237
00:12:59.514 --> 00:13:03.114
Is that, you know, reproducibility makes
any scientific

238
00:13:03.114 --> 00:13:06.376
discussion much more informed and much
more timely.

239
00:13:06.376 --> 00:13:09.730
You can see that, in this case you know, a

240
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:14.760
hypothesis was proposed that nickel was a
harmful element of PM.

241
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.030
So people brought data to address this
hypothesis.

242
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.846
They presented the evidence from the data.

243
00:13:19.846 --> 00:13:23.110
Other people, another set of
investigators, took the

244
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.871
same data, tried to look at this
hypothesis.

245
00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:28.702
Confirmed that there was a positive
association.

246
00:13:28.702 --> 00:13:30.682
But thought there was some weakness in the
present,

247
00:13:30.682 --> 00:13:33.280
presentation of the evidence, and the
strength of the evidence.

248
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.870
And so there was a back and forth that was
highly informed.

249
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.850
Because everyone was using data, and

250
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.870
everyone's kind of be, there's
transparency and analysis.

251
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.962
And people can see what others have done.

252
00:13:45.962 --> 00:13:50.390
And so this is how science evolves, how
ideas come forward, how

253
00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:55.880
good ideas come to light and bad ideas are
kind of put to rest.

254
00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.890
And that's how kind of good scientific

255
00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:02.420
exchange occurs and how science moves
forward.

256
00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.140
Moves forward.

257
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.046
So reproducibility is key to all this
entire process.

258
00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:08.052
Because it makes the entire process form

259
00:14:08.052 --> 00:14:10.600
and move in a timely manner that's
transparent.
