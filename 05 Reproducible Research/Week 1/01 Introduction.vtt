Hi everyone, welcome to Reproducible
Research.

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.460
This class is, is the fifth class in the
Data Sci Specialization.

3
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.860
And it covers a very special topic that I
think doesn't get talked about a lot.

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.730
In kind of, in typical, typical

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.330
statistical or data analysis types of
courses.

6
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.230
So even though the word reproducible
research has the word research in

7
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.770
it, it's, so we're not, it, it applies to
many different areas.

8
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.750
Not just to kind of people who are doing
research per say.

9
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.370
The basic idea is that when you do a

10
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.460
data analysis and there are many different
steps, and

11
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.620
it's, and it involves a lot of computing,
and

12
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.000
perhaps a lot of kind of of data
manipulation or processing.

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.040
It's important that you, when you
communicate what you've done and you've

14
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.570
communicated in a way that someone

15
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.490
else could actually reconstruct what
you've done.

16
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.710
So that's reproducible by someone else.

17
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.780
Now I think it's ve-, as data analyses and
data sets get more complicated,

18
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.370
it becomes harder and harder to insure

19
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.340
that whatever you've done is actually
reproducible.

20
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.810
Because sometimes, you lose a little code
over here.

21
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.480
Sometimes you forget about a, a process or
a transformation you did over here.

22
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.750
And then, if you, and then a subsequent
analyses are

23
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.360
not reproducible if you don't kind of
document all those details.

24
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.244
So what were going to talk about in this
course are kind of some basic tools that

25
00:01:09.244 --> 00:01:14.445
you can use to help make your analyses and
your work in general reproducible.

26
00:01:14.445 --> 00:01:16.713
And I'll talk about thing like Knitter and
we'll

27
00:01:16.713 --> 00:01:18.620
talk about how we can do this in RStudio.

28
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.370
And we'll talk about some basic principles
for kind of that you can

29
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.370
follow to make sure that you're work is as
reproducible as possible.

30
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.635
So I think this a very important aspect of
any data analysis in any area.

31
00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:33.995
because it's really about communicating
exactly what you've done so

32
00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:37.540
that someone else can kind of understand
what's going on.

33
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.820
In the last part of the course, we'll talk
about some case studies.

34
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.060
Of kind of where reproducibility either
went right or went horribly wrong.

35
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.428
And I think these are, these cases studies
are, are highly instructive.

36
00:01:48.428 --> 00:01:53.230
And to kind of give you a sense of what
can and can what is and is not possible.

37
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.220
So I hope you enjoy this course.

38
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.150
I think it's a really important idea and I
hope you get a lot out of it.
