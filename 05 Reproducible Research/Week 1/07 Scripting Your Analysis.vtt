[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:03.182 --> 00:00:05.955
In this course, we're going to talk a lot
about different

3
00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:09.301
tools and techniques to help you make your
work reproducible.

4
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:12.379
And now, before we get into all that,
though, I just want to kind of

5
00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.760
boil down the basic principle that we want
to deal with throughout this whole course.

6
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.000
I mean, if there's one rule that I think
we would, you would want to

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.620
adhere to, to make your work as
reproducible

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.110
as possible is that you should script
everything.

9
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.560
Scripting is really important and it's the
basic idea of writing everything down.

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.540
Back in the old days you might have
written down,

11
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.760
you know, things down on paper or in lab
notebooks.

12
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.940
But now that we have more sophisticated
computers and we can

13
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.510
program them, we write things down as pr,
as scripts or programs.

14
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.790
So I mean, if you, as, just by way of
analogy.

15
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.560
You think about you think about a great
symphony or a great piece of music.

16
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.242
You think of if

17
00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:57.594
you, if you imagine just hearing the
melody of a piece of music, okay?

18
00:00:57.594 --> 00:01:00.040
That's very interesting, it's also can be
very beautiful.

19
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.480
But often, if you look at a symphony,
there's a whole orchestra.

20
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.177
There's a whole set of musicians that are
kind of backing up the melody.

21
00:01:06.177 --> 00:01:09.492
And doing a lot of work and all that work
is really important and contributes to

22
00:01:09.492 --> 00:01:11.685
the texture, contributes to the, the kind
of

23
00:01:11.685 --> 00:01:13.514
feel of the whole piece of music, right?

24
00:01:13.514 --> 00:01:15.350
So if you been out and if you were just
hear

25
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.374
a symphony it probably would be difficult
for you to reproduce that

26
00:01:18.374 --> 00:01:19.832
sound even if you could hire your

27
00:01:19.832 --> 00:01:22.154
own orchestra because you wouldn't know
where all

28
00:01:22.154 --> 00:01:23.882
the notes were, what all the, all the

29
00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:26.838
different instruments were playing at any
given time.

30
00:01:26.838 --> 00:01:28.623
That even if you heard it a few times,

31
00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:30.930
you saw, probably still wouldn't be able
to do it.

32
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.950
And you, in particular you would
definitely not be able to

33
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.850
reproduce that sound if you were to only
hear the melody, right?

34
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.530
So, if you think about the presentation of
of an

35
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.560
analysis or of your research [COUGH] the
presentation is really

36
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.150
kind of like, like hearing the melody
alone, right?

37
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.940
The melody is really nice, it's really
important.

38
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.700
But it's, there's all this supporting
material

39
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.280
that, that's going on behind the scenes.

40
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.340
All the, the analyses that you did, all
the exploratory work,

41
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.250
all of the, kind of, dead ends that you
went down, all the

42
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.980
decisions that you made in your analysis,
which are not presented in

43
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.000
your, kind of, final presentation, whether
it's a paper or a oral presentation.

44
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.060
But they're all very important.

45
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.070
So those are the supporting

46
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.660
players, all right?

47
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.010
So just like in music in research we need
a way to

48
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.930
kind of write down everything that we did,
everything that's going on right?

49
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.240
So in music this is typically called the
score, right?

50
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.450
So the score is, is, is a way to kind of
write

51
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.700
down in musical notation all the different
things that are being played.

52
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.090
All the different things that are going
on.

53
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.020
All the notes, all the rhythms.

54
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.250
All the timings, all the instruments,
everything.

55
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.460
And so someone can look at the score and

56
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.530
say okay, well I need to put together all
these things and

57
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.720
I, every- ever- people have to play at
different times and different locations.

58
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.330
And so it's a way to, for you to

59
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.690
reproduce a piece of music as accurately
as possible.

60
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.320
And, and musicians have kind of, have
come, have

61
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.950
agreed upon a standard way to write down
music.

62
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.020
And a standard notation for doing that.

63
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.910
And so this course is essentially about,
you

64
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.940
know, defining and developing the notation
of specifying

65
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.320
a re, a research project or a data
analysis.

66
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.253
Right, so what is the, how do we write
down what the what are the

67
00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:12.260
things that we did, how did we talk about
exactly what was analyzed, what was done.

68
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.057
And so the way that we do that essentially
is through scripting, right?

69
00:03:15.057 --> 00:03:16.737
We write down computer programs.

70
00:03:16.737 --> 00:03:20.517
We talk, we we give instructions to the
computer and tell it what

71
00:03:20.517 --> 00:03:23.725
to do at any, at any given time with what
type of data.

72
00:03:23.725 --> 00:03:25.360
And so the main rule

73
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.060
for anything you in data analysis is to
write a script.

74
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.970
And the more you can do that and the less
you can kind of do things by, on

75
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.390
your own, by hand without writing it down,
the

76
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.910
better and the more reproducible your work
will be.

77
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.840
So this, so these computer programs, these
scripts that we write.

78
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.210
These are like the score for your data
analysis.

79
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.050
They tell someone else who's trying to
reproduce

80
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.670
your work exactly what happened and what
to do.

81
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.760
So, if you want to get a sense of what it
means to script something.

82
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.500
You can just load

83
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.390
up Rstudio.
And

84
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.890
when you load it up, you'll see that
there's, that you, the

85
00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.980
first thing you can do is you can open an
R script.

86
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.360
So, here we do that and this is just a
blank text file.

87
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.670
And then you can start writing R code in
here.

88
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.880
And then you'll be writ-, you'll be
programming, you'll be telling the

89
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.110
you know, R what to do in terms of a
coding language, right?

90
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.030
So this is your, this, this is the, the
easiest way to get started scripting.

91
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.630
Is to u, is to load up something like
Rstudio and, and, and use the text

92
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.997
editor that's built in.

93
00:04:20.997 --> 00:04:24.183
So, in this course we'll talk about a
bunch of other tools things

94
00:04:24.183 --> 00:04:28.508
like Nader, things like Markdown that'll
help you kind of, organize your analyses.

95
00:04:28.508 --> 00:04:31.108
But the bottom line is, to write it down,
write

96
00:04:31.108 --> 00:04:34.620
a script, write a program, and make your
work reproducible.
