00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:07.180
Hi everybody,
welcome to reproducible research.

2
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.205
The purpose of this lecture is
to introduce you to the idea of

3
00:00:10.205 --> 00:00:14.210
reproducibility and to explain why
I think it's really important.

4
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.480
Even if you dont think of yourself as
a researcher or as conducting research,

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.300
if you analyze data at all, it's
critically important that you understand

6
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.850
the ideas of reproducibility and
the problems that it introduces.

7
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.720
So I want to get that across to
everybody right off the bat so

8
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.710
you can understand it and
see why it's so important.

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.604
Now, in case you're not
familiar with the idea already,

10
00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:38.620
I thought I'd introduce some of the issues
that are raised by reproducibility by

11
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.588
drawing an analogy from another area,
and that's music.

12
00:00:41.588 --> 00:00:43.394
So before we go on any further,

13
00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:47.149
just take a quick listen to this
excerpt that I'll play for you.

14
00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:57.149
[MUSIC]

15
00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:45.325
Okay, so
that was a song called Code Monkey.

16
00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:50.625
It was written and performed by Jonathon
Colton, and I just played you the first

17
00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:54.545
minute or so of the song that got you
through the first verse and the chorus.

18
00:01:54.545 --> 00:01:55.935
So you might want to just rewind and

19
00:01:55.935 --> 00:01:59.205
just maybe listen to that excerpt one more
time just to kind of get it in your head,

20
00:01:59.205 --> 00:02:02.450
it may get stuck in your head,
so I apologize in advance.

21
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.220
But, think about that song and
what you already know about it, all right?

22
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.010
So, you know what it sounds like.

23
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.460
You have a sense of who wrote it,
who performed it.

24
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.410
You know that it starts with
a guitar in the beginning.

25
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.230
If you have a pretty good ear,
you know that it's in F major.

26
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.430
And then later on another guitar
joins as a drum kit that plays along.

27
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.690
And of course, he's singing along.

28
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.925
He's singing the words.

29
00:02:26.925 --> 00:02:28.625
And if you can listen carefully and

30
00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:32.445
you understand a language,
you could even tell what words he saying.

31
00:02:32.445 --> 00:02:34.765
And so, and
that's pretty much the whole song.

32
00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:37.075
And of course, I didn't play the whole
thing for you, but if I had,

33
00:02:37.075 --> 00:02:41.315
you could have decoded a lot of this
information just from the recording, okay?

34
00:02:41.315 --> 00:02:44.395
So most popular songs like
this are not very complicated.

35
00:02:44.395 --> 00:02:48.460
They don't have a lot of instruments or
a lot of voices, and

36
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.570
they typically range
from two to four minutes.

37
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.000
And if you're a good musician and
you can listen very carefully,

38
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.690
it's not that hard to
kind of play the song,

39
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.540
maybe on your own guitar or whatever,
after you've heard it, okay?

40
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.310
Now, okay.

41
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.612
Now, let's take a listen
to this piece now.

42
00:03:06.612 --> 00:03:16.612
[MUSIC]

43
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:45.878
Okay, so in case you didn't recognize it,

44
00:03:45.878 --> 00:03:50.390
that was the very beginning of the
Symphony Number Eight, by Gustav Mahler.

45
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.230
It was performed by
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,

46
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.240
under the baton of Sir Georg Solti.

47
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.860
And so this might be the polar opposite
of the Code Monkey song that I

48
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.230
just played for you.

49
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.110
This symphony is sometimes called
the Symphony of 1000, because just of

50
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.360
the sheer number of people that have
to be on stage to perform this piece.

51
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.420
You need an entire symphony orchestra.

52
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.259
You need an entire full chorus to sing.

53
00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:20.342
And so there's a lot of complex moving
parts needed to perform this piece,

54
00:04:20.342 --> 00:04:24.701
and yet it gets performed all the time,
and everyone recognizes

55
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:29.562
the piece when they hear it,
because it's more or less the same thing.

56
00:04:29.562 --> 00:04:31.660
Now how does that happen, right?

57
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.040
So how is it that orchestras and

58
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.880
choruses all over the world can play
this enormously complex piece and

59
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.140
it always seems to come off more or
less just the same thing, okay?

60
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.170
And similarly, how is it that you can
listen to Johnathan Colton's song and

61
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.700
you can hear the music, and then somehow,
if you are trained musician,

62
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.010
you can pick it up and
maybe play it for yourself, okay?

63
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.250
This is really about reproducibility,
right?

64
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.780
So in music, one of the nice things
about music in general is that

65
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.320
when you hear the performance, regardless
of whether it's a simple popular song or

66
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.290
an enormous symphony,
you get all the information that you need.

67
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.190
And now depending on the complexity
of the music, you may get more or

68
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.800
less information, because the brain
is only able to process so

69
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.350
much information at a time.

70
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.000
But for something that's very complicated,
like a symphony,

71
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.610
we actually have a way to
write down the instructions to

72
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.040
give to the performers to tell
them how to play each thing.

73
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.125
And so it actually,

74
00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:35.840
Mahler is a great example of this
because he himself was a conductor.

75
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.052
And he knew that as a conductor it's
often difficult to look at a composer's

76
00:05:41.052 --> 00:05:45.946
music and understand what is it
exactly that the composer wanted here?

77
00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:49.822
And so when he wrote his music, he put
instructions on every single inch of

78
00:05:49.822 --> 00:05:53.823
that piece of music, because that way
the conductor who is interpreting and

79
00:05:53.823 --> 00:05:57.449
the performers who are interpreting
the music can understand, oh,

80
00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.602
that's what the composer wanted here.

81
00:05:59.602 --> 00:06:04.160
So for Mahler's Symphony Number Eight
what we have is the score.

82
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.950
So the score is basically a book
that lists every single part

83
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.120
of every instrument, and what they need
to play, and what instructions they have.

84
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.610
And so the conductor can look
at the score, and say, okay,

85
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.460
I know what the violin's playing at this
time and I know what the flute is playing,

86
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.710
and I know what the chorus
is singing at this time.

87
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.310
And that way the music can be coordinated
and all performed, and synchronized.

88
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.060
You can have a score for a popular song
too, so Code Monkey could have a score,

89
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.300
there'd be guitar lines,
there'd be drum lines.

90
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.590
It's typically not written in the same
way that you would write a symphony, but

91
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.520
there is a notation that is
used sometimes to communicate

92
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.775
how a piece of music should be performed.

93
00:06:42.775 --> 00:06:47.810
And so what we're talking about in
this course, Reproducible Research,

94
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.780
is basically, how do you develop
the score for data analysis so

95
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.520
that you can communicate to
someone what was done, and

96
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.720
if they want to reproduce the work,
how to do it, okay?

97
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.660
Now the fundamental problem in data
analysis is that we don't really have

98
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:10.840
an agreed upon notation system for
communicating data analysis.

99
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:17.830
And so, everyone does it a different way,
and in aggregate, it's kind of a mess.

100
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.650
So some people will just describe in
words what was done, and in some cases,

101
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.330
this is suficient.

102
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.490
This is sufficient but
in many cases, it's not.

103
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.000
Some people will provide
the computer code and the data and

104
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.430
everything that you need,
and sometimes that's good.

105
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.598
But sometimes it's enormously complex and
it's difficult to sort through.

106
00:07:36.598 --> 00:07:41.900
And so there are a variety of ways that
you can communicate data analysis,

107
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.560
but we just haven't agreed upon
what is a way that we can all look,

108
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.900
that is sufficient for everybody, or
more or less sufficient for everybody.

109
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:54.160
So, what we're gonna focus
on in this course, is how to

110
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.130
communicate data analysis, using code by
writing documents that are very dynamic,

111
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.440
and by sharing data so that other people
can reproduce the work that you're doing.

112
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.600
So this is important for
all data analysis.

113
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.140
It's not just about doing research per se.

114
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.890
And because if you wanna communicate
what you've done to other people,

115
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.260
you need to be able to give them
the material so that they can perform, so

116
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.120
to speak, the analysis themselves.
