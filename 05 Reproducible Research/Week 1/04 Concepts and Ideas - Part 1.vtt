00:00:00.958 --> 00:00:01.025
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01.025 --> 00:00:04.258
This lecture will be about reproducible
research, and I want to

3
00:00:04.258 --> 00:00:07.308
just talk about some concepts and ideas
that are, that

4
00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:10.297
are related to reproducible research and
in, just in case

5
00:00:10.297 --> 00:00:13.385
you haven't heard about it or don't know
what it is.

6
00:00:13.385 --> 00:00:19.420
So the basic idea is that in science,
replication is the most important element

7
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.770
of kind of verifying and validating
findings that a scientist discover.

8
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.250
So if you claim that

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.800
x causes y, or that Vitamin C improves
disease, or that this causes a problem.

10
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.615
What happens is that, you know, other

11
00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:36.362
scientists that are independent of the
original.

12
00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:39.210
Will, will try to investigate that same
question and

13
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.360
see if they come up with the same result.

14
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.950
And if lots of different people come up
with the

15
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.430
same result and replicate the original
finding, then we can

16
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.720
tend to think that, well, the original was
probably true

17
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.720
and that this is a real relationship or
real finding.

18
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.750
So the

19
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.220
ultimate standard in strengthening
scientific evidence is replication.

20
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.500
And we, and the goal is to

21
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.420
have independent people to do independent
things with

22
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.890
different data, different methods, and
different laboratories

23
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.550
and see if you get the same result.

24
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.880
Because if a finding is robust to all
these different things then it

25
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.680
is more likely to be true and the evidence
is stronger in it's favor.

26
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.710
Replication is particularly important in
studies that have, kind

27
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.020
of had big policy impacts or can influence
regulatory types

28
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.420
of decisions.
So, what's wrong with replication?

29
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.690
So there's really nothing wrong with it.

30
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.010
This is what science has been doing for a
long time through hundreds of years.

31
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.650
And there's nothing wrong with it today.

32
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.540
But the problem is that it's very, it's
becoming

33
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.170
more and more challenging to do
replication or to

34
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.280
replicate other studies and because and
part of the

35
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.020
reason is because studies are getting
bigger and bigger.

36
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.220
In order to do big studies you need a lot
of money and so there's a lot of money

37
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.060
involved and if you want to do ten
versions of the same study, you need ten

38
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.874
times as much money and there's not as
much money around as there used to be.

39
00:01:49.874 --> 00:01:52.580
[COUGH] sometimes it's just, it's
difficult to replicate

40
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.770
a study because you know, if the original

41
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.220
study took 20 years to do, it's difficult

42
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.690
to wait around another 20 years for
replication.

43
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.930
So that can be a, a challenge.

44
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.640
Some studies are just plain unique.

45
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.020
So if you're looking at a unique situation
in time or a unique population,

46
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.410
you can't readily replicate that
situation.

47
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.080
So, there are a lot of good reasons why
you can't replicate a study.

48
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.400
And so the idea said, well, if you can't
replicate it is

49
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.240
the alternative just to do nothing, just
let that study stand by itself?

50
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.160
And so the idea behind a reproducible
research is to create a kind

51
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.370
of minimum standard or a middle ground
where we won't be replicating the study,

52
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.980
but maybe we can do something in between.

53
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.140
So the basic problem is, you know, you
have the gold standard, which is, which

54
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.080
is replication and then you have the, kind

55
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.780
of the, the worst standard which is
nothing.

56
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.593
And so, what can we do that's in between
the

57
00:02:44.593 --> 00:02:48.360
gold standard and nothing, and that's
where we're thinking is reproducibility.

58
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.540
So, that's how we can kind of bridge the
gap between replication and nothing.

59
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.910
So, why do we need this kind of middle
ground, which I haven't clearly

60
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.700
defined yet, but the basic idea is that,
you know, you

61
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.640
make the data available for the original
study, and you make the

62
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.380
computational methods available so that
other people can can, can look at

63
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.260
your data and cam run the kind of analysis
that you've run.

64
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.160
And to kind of come, come to the same
findings that you found.

65
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.320
And so a lot of this, what reproducible
research

66
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.320
is about is a validation of the data
analysis.

67
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.220
Because you're not collecting independent
data

68
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.910
using independent methods, you can, it's

69
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.960
a little bit more difficult to validate
the, the question itself that

70
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.230
you're asking, but if you can take
someone's data and repli, and

71
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.879
reproduce their findings, then you can in
some sense validate the data analysis.

72
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.040
And so this involves having the data and

73
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.760
the code because, you know, most, more
likely than

74
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.140
not, the analysis will have been done on
the

75
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.150
computer using some sort of programming
language like R.

76
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.950
And so you can take their code and their
data and reproduce the findings that they

77
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.300
come up with, then you can at least

78
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.100
have confidence that the analysis was done
appropriately.

79
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.140
And and that the correct methods were
done, were used excuse me.

80
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.430
So what is driving this need for a middle

81
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.600
ground, this reproducibility middle ground
between replication and doing nothing?

82
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.060
Well, there's a lot of new technologies on

83
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.540
the scene and in many different fields
including, biology

84
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.620
and chemistry and environmental science,
all kinds of areas.

85
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.870
These technology allow us to collect data
at a much higher throughput.

86
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.000
And so we get these very complex and very
high dimensional data sets.

87
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.870
Almost instantaneously compared to even
just ten years ago.

88
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.190
And so, the technology has allowed us to
create huge

89
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.640
data sets, at a, at essentially the touch
of a button.

90
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.650
furthermore, we have computing power that
allows us to take on

91
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.810
existing databases and merge them into,
just, even bigger and bigger databases.

92
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.000
So we can take data that were previously,
maybe,

93
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.380
inaccessible and create new data sets out
of it.

94
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.000
So these new data sets are huge now.

95
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.810
and, in addition to allowing us to create
new data sets

96
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.900
computing power allows us to, to to do
more sophisticated analysis.

97
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.830
So the analysis themselves, the models
that we fit and

98
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.760
the algorithms that we run, are much much
more complicated than they use to be.

99
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.270
And so, having a basic understanding of
these

100
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.270
algorithms is difficult, even for a
sophisticated person.

101
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.540
So, understanding what someone did in an
analysis of data will

102
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.370
require looking at code, looking at the
computer programs that people used.

103
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.950
And so the, and so the bottom line with
all these different

104
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.670
trends is that for every field x, there is
now computational x.

105
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.810
There's computational biology,
computational

106
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.730
astronomy, computational whatever is

107
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.360
you want, there is a computational version
of it.

108
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.870
So one example from research that I've
conducted

109
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.900
is in the area of air pollution and
health.

110
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.020
Now air pollution and health is a, is a
big field and it, and it involves

111
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.320
a kind of, is a confluence of features

112
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.480
that make reproducibility very important
in this area.

113
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.610
The first that we're estimating very
small,

114
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.330
but very important public health effects
in the presence of a much stronger signal.

115
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.670
So you can think about air pollution as
something that's,

116
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.140
you know, perhaps harmful but even if it
were harmful

117
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.010
there are many other things that are
going, that are

118
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.870
going to be more harmful that you have to
worry about.

119
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.870
So pollution is going to be, not at the

120
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.640
very top of the list that's going to harm
you.

121
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.160
The results of a lot of air

122
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.600
pollution research inform kind of
substantial policy decisions.

123
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.060
Regulations will

124
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.270
be based on scientific research in this
area.

125
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.990
And so these regulations can affect a lot
of stakeholders

126
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.140
and, and furthermore, can cost billions of
dollars to implement.

127
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.490
Finally, we use a lot of complex
statistical methods to do a lot

128
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.190
of these stedies and so, and these

129
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.730
statistical methods are subjected to
intense scrutiny.

130
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.220
So combinations of an, of an inherently

131
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.180
small signal large impacts, and complex
statistical methods

132
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.330
almost require that the research that we
do be reproducible.

133
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.590
And so one of the things that we've done
and here at John's

134
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.905
Hopkins is to create what's called the

135
00:06:55.905 --> 00:06:58.460
Internet-based Health and Air Pollution
Surveillance System.

136
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.400
We make a lot of our data available, we
make a

137
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.690
lot of our statistical methods in the form
of R code

138
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.270
available so that they can be examined,
and the data, and

139
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.830
many of the results that we produce can be
reproduced by others.
