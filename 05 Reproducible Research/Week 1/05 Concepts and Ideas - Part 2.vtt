1
00:00:00.525 --> 00:00:04.930
But so the basic issue here is now is that
you know, when you read an article

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.590
in literature or research article, for the
most

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.750
part what you get is the article and, you

4
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.380
as the reader get nothing else but of

5
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.530
course you know, everyone knows that
behind the scenes

6
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.890
there's a lot that went into this article

7
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.600
and that's what I call here the research
pipeline.

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.120
And you can see here that on the left

9
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.770
side here, the author is kind of going
from left

10
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.890
to right along this research pipeline.

11
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.580
And then, the you, the reader, is kind of
going from right to left.

12
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.740
So you read the article, and you want to
know more about what

13
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.510
happened, where was the data, what was,
you know, what was used here?

14
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.750
And so the basic idea is, you know, behind
reproducibility, is to

15
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.750
focus on this kind of analytic data and
this computational results box here.

16
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.010
And so with reproducibility, we hope, we
try to allow the author

17
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.240
and the reader to kind of meet in the
middle so to speak.

18
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.740
There's been a lot of discussion of recent
re, reproducible research

19
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.890
in the, in the media and the, and in the
scientific literature.

20
00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.520
The, the Journal of Science had a special

21
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.396
issue on reproducibility and data rep,
data replication,um.

22
00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:10.166
There is a recent feature in, on the TV
show 60 minutes looking at a, an

23
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:16.530
incident at Duke University where many
results were found to be not reproducible,

24
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.830
and this led to the kind of a, to a,

25
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.500
to a large kind of controversial series of
events, where

26
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.120
studies or clinical trials had to be
stopped, and a

27
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.480
lot of investigation, which is still
ongoing, had to occur.

28
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.358
Finally, the Institute of Medicine, in
response to a lot of events that have

29
00:01:34.358 --> 00:01:38.450
recent, involving reproducibility of
scientific studies, issued

30
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.590
a report kind of saying that best

31
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.780
practices, or things that should be done

32
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.710
to promote and encourage reproducibility,
and particularly

33
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.068
in what's called omics space research with

34
00:01:49.068 --> 00:01:52.030
these like genomics, proteomics, other
types of areas.

35
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.942
So, this is a, this was a very important
report.

36
00:01:55.942 --> 00:02:03.290
And one of the many recommendations that
they had, they, they, the recommended

37
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.250
that things that, stuff, things that like
data and metadata be made available.

38
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.460
That computer code be fully specified.

39
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.430
And so that people can examine it to see
what happened.

40
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.590
And then all the steps of the
computational analysis be kind

41
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.697
of described so that people can study it
and reproduce it.

42
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.160
So, what do we need for reproducible
research?

43
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.440
So, what is the definition?

44
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.800
And I think there's a variety of ways to
talk about

45
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.580
this, but one basic definition that we've
come up with is that

46
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.522
analytic data be available, so the data
that

47
00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:38.126
were used for the analysis that was
presented.

48
00:02:38.126 --> 00:02:40.430
This is different from the raw data
because

49
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.414
very often in a given analysis the raw

50
00:02:42.414 --> 00:02:47.030
data are not entire, are not all used for
an analysis but rather some subset issues.

51
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.650
Now it may be interesting to see the raw

52
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.420
data but it may be impractical to actually
have it.

53
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.950
So the analytic data is key to examining
the data analysis.

54
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.700
The analytic code

55
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.580
is also important.

56
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.010
So this may be the code that looked, that,
that

57
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.760
was applied to the analytic data and
produced key results.

58
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.150
So this may be regression modeling code.
It may be other types of things.

59
00:03:09.224 --> 00:03:12.570
Documentation of that code and the data is
very important of course.

60
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.420
And finally some standard means of
distribution, so it has

61
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.300
to be easily accessible, all this data in
this code.

62
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.770
It's important to realize that there are
multiple players when you talk

63
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.420
about reproducibility so there's different
types of

64
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.930
parties that have different types of
interest.

65
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.495
So there's, roughly speaking there are
authors who

66
00:03:30.495 --> 00:03:34.780
produce research and they want to make
their research reproducible.

67
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.650
And they need tools to kind of, make

68
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.026
their lives easier, to make their work
reproducible.

69
00:03:40.026 --> 00:03:44.186
And there's also readers who are reading
research and they want to reproduce

70
00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:48.510
that work and they also need tools to kind
of make their lives easier.

71
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.570
So, some of the challenges that are out
there right now is that authors

72
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.520
of research have to undergo considerable
effort

73
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.374
to make their results available on the
web.

74
00:03:57.374 --> 00:03:59.510
So to publish data, the publish code is

75
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.830
not necessarily a, a trivial task and
although there

76
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.610
are a number of resources available now,
that were

77
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.210
not re, available even, you know, five
years ago.

78
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.510
It's still a bit of a challenge to kind of
get things out there on the web.

79
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.260
furthermore, once, even if things are out
there, readers have to download

80
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.360
the data, they have to download, look at
the results, they have

81
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.890
to download the code, they have to piece
things together, usually by

82
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.320
hand and it's not always an easy task to
put these things together.

83
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.550
furthermore, readers may not have the same
resources that

84
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.970
the original authors did, so if the
original authors use

85
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.410
an enormous computing cluster, for
example, to do their analysis,

86
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.060
the readers may not have that same
enormous computing cluster

87
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.920
at their disposal, so it may be difficult
for

88
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.310
readers to to do exactly reproduce the
same results.

89
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.690
And then, so, and generally the toolbox
for

90
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.669
doing reproducible research is small,
although it's definitely growing.

91
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.440
But it still, there are a lot of needs.

92
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.090
So what happens, in reality, is that
authors

93
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.720
just kind of throw things up on the web.

94
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.280
There are, there may be journals,

95
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.420
supplementary materials that are famously
disorganized.

96
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.362
And there

97
00:05:03.362 --> 00:05:07.050
are only a few central databases where,
that, authors can take

98
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.350
advantage of to post their data and make
their data available.

99
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.440
So if you're working in a field that has

100
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.090
a kind of central database that everyone
uses, that's great.

101
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.400
But if you're not, then you're kind of out
of luck.

102
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.080
furthermore, the readers just end up just
kind of

103
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.310
downloading the data, putting the code
together by hand.

104
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.480
And they have to kind of piece together

105
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.350
the software and it can be difficult to
do.
