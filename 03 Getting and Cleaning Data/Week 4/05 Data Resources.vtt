00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.800
This lecture is just to point
you to some data resources so

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.460
you might be able to get some free data,
and do some of analysis,

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.960
if you don't happen to have any at
the organization that you're at.

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.058
So this website consists of data from
a variety of national organizations.

5
00:00:15.058 --> 00:00:18.376
So we can start off with
the United Nations data sets,

6
00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:20.293
which are at this website, and

7
00:00:20.293 --> 00:00:25.222
then you can find data that are available
from the United States at data.gov.

8
00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:29.360
And you can go to this blog post to
find a bunch of other cities and

9
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.220
states within the United States
that have open data.

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.590
There's also a lot more information
on a variety of other countries and

11
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.890
this website down here
data.gov/opendatasites actually gives

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.380
information on data sites for
other countries all around the world.

13
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.860
So that's a good place to start if you

14
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.750
don't know if your country has
an open government data site.

15
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.190
Gapminder is another
website that has a lot of

16
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.840
data about development in
particular in human heath.

17
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.380
And so there's a large number
of datasets that are available

18
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.360
on that website which is Gapminder.org.

19
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.650
You can also get survey data
from the United States.

20
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.150
This website here gives you a lot of
information about how do you actually

21
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.600
access the surveys and process them in R.

22
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.940
So it's actually really nice because the
surveys are often very big and unwieldy,

23
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.680
and this website gives you a lot of
information on how to access them.

24
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.565
The Infochimps Marketplace
has a bunch of different

25
00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:25.478
data sets which you can sort
by various different tags, and

26
00:01:25.478 --> 00:01:28.408
you can identify data sets that
might be of interest to you.

27
00:01:28.408 --> 00:01:30.550
Some of them are free, and
some of them cost money.

28
00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:34.690
Kaggle is another place that
you can go to for data sets.

29
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.760
So Kaggle is a company that offers data
science competitions, and they often have

30
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.250
very interesting data sets that they make
available as part of those competitions.

31
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.520
So they're good for practice, but they're
also good for potentially discovering new,

32
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.140
interesting things that can help
companies solve real problems.

33
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.800
There's also some collections that
have been put together by famous data

34
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.510
scientists.

35
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.630
So these are several data scientists.

36
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.930
Hilary Mason, Jeff Hammerbacher,
and others who have

37
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.020
put together data sets that are research
quality and that might be useful for you.

38
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.160
These all come from this blog post which
talks about several other data sets,

39
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.320
they're curated by other
data scientists as well.

40
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.718
There are also a large variety of other,
more specialised collections.

41
00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:19.543
So for example, the Stanford
Large Network Data Archive has

42
00:02:19.543 --> 00:02:24.268
a large number of data sets that focus
on network data, machine learning,

43
00:02:24.268 --> 00:02:29.068
the UCI Machine Learning archive has
a variety of data sets that can be used to

44
00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:32.160
practice your classification or
predictions.

45
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.430
The CMU Statlib is one of the most
famous canonical sets of data sets that

46
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.438
are available.

47
00:02:37.438 --> 00:02:41.899
Gene Expression Omnibus is focused on
data sets that come from human genomic

48
00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:45.338
experiments or
other organismal genomics experiments.

49
00:02:45.338 --> 00:02:50.679
And then there's data from the ArXiv or
public datasets on Amazon web services.

50
00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:54.185
Finally, there a large number of APIs
that you've now learned how to use,

51
00:02:54.185 --> 00:02:55.808
through the course of this class.

52
00:02:55.808 --> 00:03:00.369
And so, for example, there's specific
packages such as the twitter package which

53
00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:02.425
can be used to access the Twitter API,

54
00:03:02.425 --> 00:03:06.430
in an easier way than trying to
set up a application yourself.

55
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.722
You can similarly get
access to figshare data or

56
00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:12.610
to data from publications like Plos one.

57
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.660
rOpenSci has a large number of very
nice packages that allow you to access

58
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.180
data from a variety of sources
that are focused on academics.

59
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.420
There's also dedicated R packages for
Facebook and Google Maps.

60
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.656
All of these mean that there is really no
excuse to not be able to find real data to

61
00:03:28.656 --> 00:03:30.880
focus on any project that
you might be interested in.
