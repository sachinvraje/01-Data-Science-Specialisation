00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.720
If there were a competition for
the most useful distribution, that's over.

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.850
The normal distribution
won it in a landslide.

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.670
However, we could have a pretty
active discussion about what

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.050
deserves second place.

5
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.080
The Poisson distribution would
certainly be in the running.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.820
At any rate, the Poisson distribution
is used to model counts.

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.820
The Poisson mask function is lambda
to the x, e to the negative lambda,

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.150
all over x factorial where x is
defined on the non-negative integers.

9
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.970
Zero, one, two and so on.

10
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.299
The mean of a Poisson random variable
is lambda, this parameter here.

11
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.750
And the variance of this
distribution is also lambda.

12
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.350
So that's an interesting thing to take
into account when you model things is if

13
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.070
they're a poisson.

14
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.310
The mean and
the variance have to be equal.

15
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.220
Which of you have repeated poisson data,
this is a checkable assumption.

16
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.099
I'd like to get some instances where
we use the poisson distribution.

17
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.170
Any time you want to model count data,
the Poisson distribution is a candidate.

18
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.510
Especially if those counts are unbounded.

19
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.760
There's also another set of
data that's very common in

20
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.930
the field of bio-statistics.

21
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.550
So called event time or survival data.

22
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.830
So for example, in cancer trials,
you might be trying out a new therapy.

23
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.370
You would model the time until people
have a recurrence of some symptoms.

24
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.580
Some people may not ever
have that recurrence.

25
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.260
And some people may,
in the time of the study.

26
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.210
You need special statistical
techniques to deal with that so,

27
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.050
that so,
that problem of so-called censoring.

28
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.760
And those techniques have a deep
connection with the Poisson distribution.

29
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.770
Whenever you take a sample of people and

30
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.190
you classify them according
to some characteristics, and

31
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.670
just look at the counts of
the people of various hair colors.

32
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.020
That's called a contingency table.

33
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.580
You can create plot,
cross classified contingency table for

34
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.930
example you were to count
hair color by race, and

35
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.760
each cell would be the specific
race hair color combination.

36
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.990
The count of the people in the sample
that had that specific combination.

37
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.250
The Poisson distribution is the devault,

38
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.950
default distribution for
modeling contingency table data.

39
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.930
And it turns out that it has again
a deep connection with some of

40
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.980
the other models you might think to use
such as multi nomials, binomials, and

41
00:02:23.986 --> 00:02:28.770
A final instance where the poisson
is used, and this is done so

42
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.740
commonly it's not even really stated
as people, people are doing it.

43
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.950
Is in instances where you have a binomial,
but n is very large and p is very small.

44
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.420
This, for example, happens very
commonly in the field of epidemiology.

45
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.210
My friend Roger studies air pollution.

46
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.230
And he looks at,
as air pollution rates rise and

47
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.478
fall, the number of new cases of say,
respiratory diseases.

48
00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:56.320
In large areas, like cities for example.

49
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.940
Well the n is very large,
the population of the city,

50
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.330
but the number of events that he's
looking at are often quite small.

51
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.300
And so
he models those as if they were poisson.

52
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.830
And this is done so commonly in the field
of epidemiology that people don't even

53
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.070
really say when they're doing it.

54
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.960
They just do it, and
everyone knows what they're talking.

55
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.780
The Poisson distribution is
often used to model rates.

56
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.580
So for example,
let's let x be Poisson lambda t.

57
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.170
It's important to note that
lambda here has units.

58
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.220
It's the average number
of events per unit time,

59
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.740
where t is expressed in that,
that particular time unit.

60
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.240
So lambda is the expected count per unit
time, and t is the total monitoring time.

61
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.939
So this is a very common use of the
Poisson distribution for modeling rates.

62
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.190
So, imagine if the number of people that
show up to a bus stop is Poisson with

63
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.970
a mean of 2.5 people per hour.

64
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.960
We watch the bus stop for four hours.

65
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.630
What's the probability that three or

66
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.080
four, three or
fewer people show up the whole time?

67
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.520
So that's just the Poi,
Poisson probability of three, three, two,

68
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.080
one, and zero.

69
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.077
And the rate we want at
this point is not 2.5.

70
00:04:07.077 --> 00:04:08.000
Cause it's 2.5 events prior.

71
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.070
But we watched it for four hours.

72
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.220
So we want to put in
a rate of 2.5 times four.

73
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.790
And here we get
the probability here of 1%.

74
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.380
Let's talk about the Poisson
approximation to the binomial.

75
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.060
Particularly when n is large and
p is small.

76
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.510
The Poisson can be a quite accurate
approximation of the binomial.

77
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.570
To tie down notation,
let's let x be binomial n, p.

78
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.550
And define lambda as n times p.

79
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.170
But here we're considering circumstances
where n is very large, and

80
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.610
p is very small.

81
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.520
Then the proposal is that the probability
distribution governing acts which is

82
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.210
binomial can be well approximated by

83
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:56.280
Poisson probabilities with this
specific notation lambda as n times p.

84
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.800
As our final example to this,
to discussing the Poisson distribution.

85
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.160
Let's go through a Poisson
approximation of the binomial.

86
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:13.770
So imagine if we were to flip a coin
with success probability 0.01 500 times.

87
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.450
What's the probability of two or
fewer successes?

88
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.060
This is simply to illustrate that I have
a setting that's a binomial probability

89
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.100
with a large n, 500, and a small p, 0.01.

90
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.140
And now I want, but

91
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.450
it's, it's still in the realm where
the binomial calculations are possible.

92
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.590
So here when I do pbinom, for two,
because the question asked for two or

93
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.984
fewer successes, size equals 500,
500 coin flips, probability equals .01,

94
00:05:39.984 --> 00:05:42.929
suggesting that the true success
probability of the problem.

95
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.846
Of the coin is .01.

96
00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.590
I get around 12%.

97
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.120
When I do the same calculation with
Poisson, two and then now instead of

98
00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:02.680
inputting the size and the probability, I
put in lambda as n times p 500 times .01.

99
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.369
I get 12, 12.5%.

100
00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:08.470
So, fairly close.
