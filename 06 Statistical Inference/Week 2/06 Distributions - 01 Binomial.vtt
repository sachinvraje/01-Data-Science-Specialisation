Hi, my name is Brian Caffo and
welcome to the lecture on

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.770
some common distributions in
the Statistical Inference Coursera class,

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.200
as part of our data
science specialization.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.620
The specialization is co-taught with
my co-instructors Jeff Leek and

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.510
Roger Peng,
we're all at Johns Hopkins University in

6
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.170
the Department of Biostatistics in
the Bloomberg School of Public Health.

7
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.700
Let's start with perhaps the simplest
distribution, the Bernoulli distribution.

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.880
The Bernoulli distribution is named after
Jacob Bernoulli, a famous mathematician,

9
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.490
who actually comes from a family of famous
mathematicians, and if you're interested,

10
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.910
you can read up on the Bernoulli's, they
have lots of Wikipedia pages, for example.

11
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.940
So, the Bernoulli di, distribution arises
out of a coin flip, say, with a zero for

12
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.400
a tail and a one for a head, and
you have a potentially biased coin with

13
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.710
probabilities, p for a head and
1 minus p for a tail We usually write

14
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.090
the Bernoulli probability mass function as
p to the x, 1 minus p, to the 1 minus x.

15
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.080
The mean of a Bernoulli random variable is
p, and the variance is p times 1 minus p,

16
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.770
we've seen these facts before.

17
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.430
And if we,
let x be a Bernoulli random variable,

18
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.810
we typically call x equal 1 as a success,
eve, regardless of whether or not

19
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.090
the outcome is successful in some sense of
the word, and x equal to 0 as a failure.

20
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.000
Now that we've discussed
the Bernoulli distribution,

21
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.050
let's talk about
the binomial distribution.

22
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.530
The bino, a binomial random variable
is obtained as the sum of a bunch of

23
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.530
iid Bernoulli random variables.

24
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.150
So ostensibly, a binomial random variable,

25
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.320
is the total number of heads,
on the flips of a potentially biased coin.

26
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.760
Mathematically, let's let x 1
to x n be Bernoulli p, then x,

27
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.250
the sum of them,
is a binomial random variable.

28
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.080
The binomial mass function looks a lot
like the Bernoulli mass function,

29
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.769
though with n choose x out front.

30
00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:56.269
.

31
00:01:57.809 --> 00:02:02.376
Recall that the notation n choose
x stands for n factorial over x

32
00:02:02.376 --> 00:02:07.650
factorial n minus x factorial, and
n choose 0 and n choose n are both 1.

33
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.356
This solves a particular
common notarial problem of

34
00:02:10.356 --> 00:02:13.367
counting the number of the ways
of selecting x items out of n

35
00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:16.643
without replacement disregarding
the ordering of the items.

36
00:02:16.643 --> 00:02:20.660
Let's go through a quick example
of a binomial calculation.

37
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.674
Suppose you have a friend who has eight
children, seven of which are girls and

38
00:02:24.674 --> 00:02:25.549
none are twins.

39
00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.036
If each gender has an independent
50% probability for each birth,

40
00:02:29.036 --> 00:02:33.690
what's the probability of getting seven or
more girls out of eight births?

41
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.901
Well let's plug right into
the binomial formula.

42
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:41.427
That's the probability of seven,
which is 8 choose 7, .5 to the 7,

43
00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:44.858
1 minus .5 to the 1 plus 8 choose 8,
.5 to the 8,

44
00:02:44.858 --> 00:02:48.810
1 minus .5 to the 0 which works
out to be a val, a 4% chance.

45
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.881
Here, I give you the r code for
performing this calculation.

46
00:02:54.881 --> 00:03:00.045
Also, as with, most of the common
distributions there's an r function and

47
00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:02.800
pbinom gives you these probabilities.
