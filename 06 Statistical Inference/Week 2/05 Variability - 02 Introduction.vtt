00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.640
Hi, my name is Brian Caffo, and

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.830
this is a lecture on Variability as part
of the Statistical Inference Coursera

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.150
class, which is part of
the Data Science specialization from

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.610
the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of
Public Health Department of Biostatistics.

5
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.140
So in the last lecture,
we talked about the population mean

6
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.220
which talks about where
the distribution is centered at.

7
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.440
So if you were to think about a bell
curve, that probability density function

8
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.290
will move to the left or
the right as the mean changes.

9
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.400
Another useful property is how fat or
how thin, or how spread out or

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.879
how concentrated the density is around
the mean and that's the variance.

11
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.192
So if X is a random variable that has mean
mu, the variance is exactly the expected

12
00:00:43.192 --> 00:00:49.240
square of distance the random variable is
from the mean and I give the formula here.

13
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.800
There's a nice shortcut one that
is the expected value of X squared

14
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.329
minus the expected value
of X quantity squared.

15
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.100
So densities with higher variance
are more spread out than densities with

16
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.720
lower variances and the square root of the
variance is called the Standard Deviation.

17
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.680
So the variance is expressed in the unit
squared, whereas the standard deviation is

18
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.570
expressed in the same units as X,
which is quite useful.

19
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.810
In this class, we won't spend a lot
of time calculating expected values,

20
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.610
either means or

21
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.900
variances of populations by hand, but
I want to go through one such calculation.

22
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.777
Recall from the last lecture,

23
00:01:26.777 --> 00:01:31.145
the expected value of X is 3.5 when
X is the result of the toss of a die.

24
00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:35.010
The expected value of X squared, I really
haven't given you a formula how to

25
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.160
do that, but really think of it as
the expected value of the random variable

26
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.440
that you get by rolling a die,
then squaring the result.

27
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.450
And you can do that by simply
taking the number, for

28
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.700
example 1 squared, 2 squared,
3 squared, 4 squared, 5 squared and

29
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.550
multiplying by their associated
probabilities and you get 15.17.

30
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.140
So if I were to subtract
15.17 minus 3.5 squared,

31
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.750
I get 2.92 which is the variance of this,
of a die roll.

32
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.780
Since that was so much fun,
let's do another example.

33
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.370
So imagine the toss of a coin with
the probability of heads of p.

34
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.250
We already covered that the expected
value of a coin toss is p

35
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.480
from the last lecture and then let's think
about the expected value of X squared.

36
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.206
When this case, 0 squared is 0 and
1 squared is 1, so

37
00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:24.050
the expected value of X squared is exactly
the expected value of X, which is p.

38
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.250
Now if we were to plug into our formula,
we then get p minus p squared,

39
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.260
which works out to be p times 1 minus p.

40
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.890
So in other words, the variance,
the population variance associated with

41
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.190
the distribution given
by the flip of a coin,

42
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.120
a biased coin is exactly
p times 1 minus p.

43
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.240
This is a very famous formula and

44
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.160
I'd recommend that you
just commit it to memory.

45
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.130
Here, I'm giving you some
examples of densities,

46
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.010
population densities as
the variance changes.

47
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.500
The salmon colored density is
a standard normal which has variance 1.

48
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.690
As I go up, you see the variance
increases, it squashes the density down,

49
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.390
and it pushes more of
the mass out into the tails.

50
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.610
So there's more likely that a person say,
is beyond 5, if for

51
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.890
example they are from the normal
distribution with a variance of 4,

52
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.305
than if they were from a normal
distribution with a variance of 3.

53
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.010
So just like the population mean and
the sample mean were directly analogous,

54
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.160
the population variance and the sample
variance are dir, directly analogous.

55
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.550
So for example, the population mean was
the center of mass of the population.

56
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.459
The sample mean was the center
of mass of the observed data.

57
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.970
The population variance
is the expected square of

58
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.000
distance of a random variable from
the population around the population mean.

59
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.450
The sample variance is the average
square of distance of the da,

60
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.090
observed observations
minus the sample mean.

61
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.570
So we do divide by n minus 1 here
in the denominator rather than n,

62
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.520
and I'll talk about why in a minute.

63
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.010
But I also want to talk about
a conceptually, for me,

64
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.990
kind of difficult point, which is to talk
about the variance of the sample variance.

65
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.220
So let me remind you that the sample
variance is exactly a function of data.

66
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.810
So it is also a random variable, thus
it also has a population distribution.

67
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.830
That distribution has a expected value and
that expected value is

68
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.980
the population variance that the sample
variance is trying to estimate.

69
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.910
And as you collect more and

70
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.120
more data, the distribution of the sample
variance is going to get more concentrate,

71
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.030
concentrated around the population
variance it's trying to estimate.

72
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.370
And then I also simply want to
remind you that the square root of

73
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.719
the sample variance is the sample
