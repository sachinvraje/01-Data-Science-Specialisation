1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.680
Probabilities.

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.570
Definitely, the most important
distribution to know is

3
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.020
the normal distribution.

4
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.390
We'll see in the next lecture why it's so

5
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.760
important, or
one of the reasons why it's so important.

6
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.190
But nonetheless, if all the distributions
were to get together and

7
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.940
elect a leader, it would for
sure be the normal distribution.

8
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.890
So anyway a random variable is
set to follow a normal Gaut, or

9
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.270
Gaussian distribution with mean mu and
variance sigma squared.

10
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.060
If its associated density is this
function here with the bell curve,

11
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.880
which we'll show in a minute.

12
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.160
If X is a random variable
with this density,

13
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.620
then the expected value of X is mu,
and its variance is sigma squared.

14
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.880
And we simply write this in shorthand
as X, with a little tilde here,

15
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.630
normal mu sigma squared.

16
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.680
When mu equals 0 and sigma equals 1,

17
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.700
the resulting distribution is called
the standard normal distribution.

18
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.549
And standard normal random
variables are often labeled z.

19
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.770
Here I draw the standard
normal density function,

20
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.150
the famous bell curve that
you've probably seen before.

21
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.850
Remember, that for the standard normal
distribution, its mean is 0 and

22
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.760
its standard deviation and variance are 1.

23
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.890
Here I've drawn 1 standard deviation above
and below the mean, 2 standard deviations

24
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.550
above and below the mean, and 3 standard
deviations above and below the mean.

25
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.100
The units of

26
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.780
the standard normal can be thought
of as just standard deviation units.

27
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.250
For example if you go 1 in this direction
you've gone 1 standard deviation unit.

28
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.310
And I would note that for non-standard
normals, it makes a lot of sense and

29
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.290
I think statisticians just kind
of get use to reverting back to

30
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.770
the standard normal by virtue of talking
about standard deviations from the mean.

31
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.810
So if you want to know the probability
that a non-standard normal,

32
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.760
is between mu plus 1 sigma, where mu and

33
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.720
sigma are from it's distribution and
mu minus 1 sigma.

34
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.266
So that would be the area between 1
standard deviation [NOISE] from the mean

35
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.257
for the non-standard normal.

36
00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:07.211
Well, that is exactly the same
probability area for one, for

37
00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:11.400
the, between minus 1 and
plus 1 on the standard normal.

38
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.720
So basically,
all normal distributions look identical.

39
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.150
The only thing that changes
is the units along the axis.

40
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.520
And then if you revert, when you're
talking about normal probabilities to

41
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.770
talking about standard deviations from
the mean, all the probabilities and

42
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.690
everything revert back to
the standard normal calculations.

43
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.160
We'll go through some of the examples but
that's the intuition.

44
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.530
Let me go through some basic reference
probabilities on the standard normal

45
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.850
distribution and draw on their,
maybe this will help us remember them.

46
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.148
So if we talk about one standard
deviation from the mean,

47
00:02:46.148 --> 00:02:50.008
in the standard normal distribution or
any normal distribution.

48
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:55.239
1 standard deviation from the, the mean,
then about 34% should lie here, and

49
00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.495
34% of the mass should lie here.

50
00:02:57.495 --> 00:03:03.984
So that this total area within 1 standard
deviation right here [NOISE] is 68%.

51
00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:11.700
Let's now look at two standard deviations.

52
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.580
So this magenta area here.

53
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.750
So if we go from minus two to plus two,
and

54
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.270
this is on any normal distribution,
the probability of it being, a nor,

55
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.970
a normal distribution being within
two standard deviations of the mean.

56
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.977
The probability mass
associated with that is 95%.

57
00:03:29.977 --> 00:03:33.514
That leaves 2.5% in either tail.

58
00:03:36.984 --> 00:03:39.854
We'll use that frequently when we
talk about confidence intervals.

59
00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:48.162
Now let's look at three standard
deviations from the mean.

60
00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:56.937
That area is about 99% of the mass.

61
00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:59.560
Thought it's hard to read but
it's about 99% of the mass.

62
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.810
So these reference probabilities
you should just commit to memory.

63
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.284
Let's go over some simple rules for moving
between standard and non-standard normals.

64
00:04:10.284 --> 00:04:13.859
So if X is normal with mean
mu in varying sigma squared,

65
00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.626
then if we convert the units if of X
to standard deviations from the mean.

66
00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:20.857
In other words,
subtract off the mean mu and

67
00:04:20.857 --> 00:04:23.480
divide by the standard deviation sigma.

68
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.400
The resulting random variable
Z is a standard normal.

69
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.230
Conversely, if we have
a standard normal and

70
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.380
we convert back to the units
of the original data.

71
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.680
In other words,
we multiply times sigma and add the mean.

72
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.460
The resulting random variable X is
non standard normal with mean mu and

73
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.140
variance sigma squared.

74
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.150
We've already discussed this
first bullet point here.

75
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.140
That 68%, 95%, and 99% of the normal
distribution lies within 1, 2, and

76
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:55.190
3 standard deviations from the mean,
respectively.

77
00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.735
Let's also talk about some standard normal
quantiles that we should commit to memory.

78
00:05:04.405 --> 00:05:07.140
I'm drawing a normal
distribution right here.

79
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.312
And let me put the point, minus 1.28.

80
00:05:11.312 --> 00:05:14.940
The mean is of course 0, of course,
the standard normal distribution.

81
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.050
That point is such that 10% of the
density, this is of course is not drawn to

82
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.160
a very good scale, 10% of the den, density
lies below it and then 90% lies above it.

83
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.099
Now for a not necessarily stan,
not standard normal,

84
00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:42.470
this point is not negative 1.28,
it's mu minus 1.28 times sigma.

85
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.004
And this point right here is mu.

86
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.730
But then that would follow the same rule.

87
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.167
10% of this potentially
non-standard normal

88
00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:56.568
distribution lies below
the point mu minus 1.28 sigma.

89
00:05:56.568 --> 00:06:05.459
By symmetry, this point right here,
1.28 on the standard normal distribution,

90
00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:10.590
is the quantile,
such that 10% lies above it.

91
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:20.830
For potentially non-standard normal, this
point would be mu plus 1.28 times sigma.

92
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.871
So this point 1.28,
on the standard normal and

93
00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:28.200
mu plus 1.28 times sigma on
the potentially non-standard normal.

94
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.929
Would be the point such that 10% lies
above it, and 90% lies below it.

95
00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:40.700
Let's do one more.

96
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.110
One of the more important quantiles
that we have to remember is 1.96,

97
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.984
or close enough to 2,
we often round it up to 2.

98
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.950
Negative 1.96 is the point
that such that 2.5%

99
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.440
of the mass of the normal
distribution lies below it.

100
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:06.930
And positive 1.96 is the point such
that 2.5% of the mass lies above it.

101
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.575
This would mean that 97.5% lie
above this point right here, and

102
00:07:11.575 --> 00:07:14.980
97.5 lies below that point right there.

103
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:21.250
So that 95% lies in between.

104
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.800
If we're dealing with a potentially
non-standard normal, notice then it's mu

105
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:34.050
minus 1.96 times sigma and
mu plus 1.96 times sigma.

106
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.880
Or again the center there would be mew and
for

107
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.660
the standard normal,
the center would be 0.

108
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.665
Of course notice this calculation for

109
00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:42.545
the standard normal when you
plug-in mu equal to 0 and

110
00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:47.320
sigma equal to 1, just of course gives you
back the correct number, 1.96 by itself.

111
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:53.759
Let's go through some quick
calculations of increasing difficulty.

112
00:07:54.770 --> 00:08:01.150
So first what is the 95th percentile of
a normal mu sigma squared distribution?

113
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:08.890
So in other words we want
the point X.95 from a normal

114
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:14.890
distribution having mean mu in variant
sigma squared so that 95% lies below it.

115
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.001
You want that to be 95% and that to be 5%.

116
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:25.830
So this is the value if we were to
draw samples from this population.

117
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.990
This would be the point such
that 95% of the samples would be

118
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.082
smaller than if we were to draw
a sufficiently large sample.

119
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:41.940
The easy answer is to use the q
qualifier for the density in R.

120
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:47.395
In this case qnorm and
the quintile that we want .95.

121
00:08:47.395 --> 00:08:51.680
And make sure that we plug-in the mean,
mu, and standard deviation that we wants.

122
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.180
The square root of sigma squared.

123
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.504
Make sure you plugin the standard
deviation not the variants.

124
00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.330
But there's another way
to do this that's easy.

125
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.120
Because we have our standard
normal quartiles memorized.

126
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.360
So we know for the standard
normal which is centered at 0 and

127
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:13.090
the units along the axis are standard
deviation units from the mean.

128
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.984
That the point 1.645 standard
deviations from the mean Is

129
00:09:16.984 --> 00:09:19.560
the point such that 95% lies below it.

130
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:23.610
And 5% lies above it.

131
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:30.580
So, we know that for a non-standard
normal, the point that follows

132
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:35.799
the same probability, the quantile that
has the same 95% below it and 5% above it.

133
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.990
Has to be exactly 1.645 standard
deviations from the mean.

134
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.120
So we can simply take mu
plus sigma times 1.645 and

135
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.470
that will have to give us our answer.

136
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.620
Let me answer a highly generic
question and as we go through it,

137
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.300
I think it will inform some of our
next couple of questions where we

138
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.456
put some context around it.

139
00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:03.190
So what is the probability that a normal
mu sigma squared is larger than x?

140
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:08.830
So take our normal distribution that's
non standard so it's centered at mu.

141
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:12.380
And the width is governed by
the variable sigma squared.

142
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:21.310
And take a point X, we'd want to
know what's this area right here.

143
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:28.603
So in R, we could just do p norm,
x mean equals

144
00:10:28.603 --> 00:10:33.022
mu, standard deviation equals sigma,
of course remember that you

145
00:10:33.022 --> 00:10:38.440
plugin the sigma value,
not sigma squared value.

146
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.533
Otherwise you'll get it very wrong.

147
00:10:39.533 --> 00:10:45.752
And then we want lower.tail
equals false to tell

148
00:10:45.752 --> 00:10:52.887
R that we want the upper tail
rather than the lower tail.

149
00:10:52.887 --> 00:10:57.750
Or you could omit that,
you could omit that and do 1 minus that.

150
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.970
Okay that's the easy way.

151
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.750
But a conceptually easy way to do it and
in a way that we can kind of do these

152
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:09.170
things in my head and get a sense of what
the probabilities are like rather quickly.

153
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:14.921
Is to convert X into how many standard
deviations from the mean it is.

154
00:11:14.921 --> 00:11:19.800
To do that we simply take X,
subtract off the mean mu and

155
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.630
divide by the standard deviation sigma.

156
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.340
This new number here is
simply X expressed in

157
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.660
how many standard deviations
from the mean it is.

158
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.950
So, for example, if this works out to
be around two standard deviations from

159
00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:37.135
the mean, we know that,
that should be about 2.5%.

160
00:11:37.135 --> 00:11:42.440
So let's put some context around this
by considering a specific example.

161
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.340
Assume the number of daily ad clicks for

162
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.670
companies is approximately
normally distributed with a mean

163
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.140
of 1,020 clicks per day, and
a standard deviation of 50 clicks per day.

164
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:57.060
Well let's assume that, a get,
days are sort of a random sample of days,

165
00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.170
in that if we're talking
about a specific day,

166
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.160
it's a draw from this
general distribution.

167
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.858
What's the probability of getting more
than 1,060 clicks on a given day?

168
00:12:06.858 --> 00:12:14.370
Well, 1,160 clicks is 2.8 standard
deviations from the mean.

169
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.059
So we know this probability has to
be pretty low because it's about 3,

170
00:12:18.059 --> 00:12:20.450
almost 3 standard
deviations from the mean.

171
00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.780
We remember, we remember that 3 standard
deviations is pretty far out into

172
00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.080
the tail of the normal.

173
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.320
So we know that this probability's
gotta be fairly small.

174
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.650
But let's work through it.

175
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.950
So it's not very likely.

176
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.149
We can obtain that with pnorm,

177
00:12:35.149 --> 00:12:40.490
1,160, mean equals 1,020,
standard deviation equals 50.

178
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.490
And we put lower tail equals false
because we want the probability being

179
00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:45.433
larger than it.

180
00:12:45.433 --> 00:12:48.020
And we get .003 about.

181
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.630
Just to illustrate that if we do this
calculation directly using the standard

182
00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:58.240
normal distribution, where we've
expressed 1,160 as the number of

183
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.050
standard deviations from mean that it is,
then we get the same answer.

184
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.659
I plug-in pnorm 2.8 and
do lower.tail equals false and

185
00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:07.979
of course it gives us the same number.

186
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.270
So we've done a probability calculation,

187
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.320
let's do a quantile
calculation that's similar.

188
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.060
Assume that the number of daily ad clicks
for this company is approximately normally

189
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.590
distributed with a mean of 1020 and
a standard deviation of 50.

190
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.880
What number of daily ad clicks
would represent the one

191
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.710
where 75% have fewer clicks?

192
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:31.190
And again we're going to assume
the days are our random sample from

193
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:32.150
a population of days.

194
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.385
There are samples.

195
00:13:33.385 --> 00:13:36.130
So we're not going to be concerned
about whether one day being

196
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.330
close to another day.

197
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.778
Is going to be more co-related or
whether weekend days have more clicks or

198
00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:42.390
fewer clicks than weekday days.

199
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:46.754
Or any of these intricacies that we'll
learn later on in the class how to

200
00:13:46.754 --> 00:13:47.930
deal with better.

201
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:55.590
Let's do some just scratch work before we
go to R and actually do the calculation.

202
00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.960
Here's our normal distribution with 1,020.

203
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.110
Because 1,020 is both the mean and

204
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:06.150
the median,
of this specific normal distribution.

205
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:11.620
We know that, that point is the point
where about 50% lie below it.

206
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.890
So whatever number we get,
it has to be above 1020.

207
00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:23.564
Also consider one standard deviation
above the mean, [NOISE] 1070.

208
00:14:23.564 --> 00:14:31.700
That point, recall, between one standard
deviation, recall that was 68%.

209
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.670
Well that leaves out this
little tail right here.

210
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.000
Let's see if we can think about that.

211
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.250
Well if there's 68% between these two
numbers, that would put 32% outside

212
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.840
of it and then 16% in either tail because
the normal distribution is symmetric.

213
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.140
So from 1070 below should be about 84%.

214
00:14:53.480 --> 00:15:00.269
So we know that whatever number we get
has to be between 1,020 and 1,070.

215
00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:04.025
And here's the command right
here where we do qnorm 0.75,

216
00:15:04.025 --> 00:15:09.140
mean equal to 1,020 and standard
deviation equal to 50 and of course we

217
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.799
get a number between the two numbers
that we were talking about before, 1,054
