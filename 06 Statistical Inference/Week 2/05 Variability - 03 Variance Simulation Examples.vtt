00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.960
Imagine if I were to do the following.

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.180
Simulate ten standard normals and take
their sample variance and do that over and

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.440
over and over again.

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.670
Then I get a distribution
of sample variances.

5
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.010
And that, that's exactly the salmon
colored density right here is if I

6
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.810
were to repeat that process thousands and
thousands of times.

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.960
What I was talking about, that Rissotto
was talking about on the previous slide is

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.950
merely that this distribution,
if I were to sample enough of

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.500
them, its center of mass
will exactly be one.

10
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.400
The variance from the original
population that I was sampling from.

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.300
The standard normal,
which has variance one.

12
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.330
The same will also be true for

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.440
sample variances of 20 observations
from this distribution.

14
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.500
So I sampled sta, 20 standard normals,
take their sample variance and

15
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.170
then repeat that process over and
over and over again to get

16
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.830
an idea about the distribution of sample
variances of 20 standard normals.

17
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.970
And then I get this more aqua color
distribution, that's the second one, and

18
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.090
it is also centered at one.

19
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.220
The same thing when I do it for 30.

20
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.410
But notice what happens, the variance, the
population variance in the distribution

21
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.310
of the sample variance gets more
concentrated as I have more data.

22
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.190
So in other words, saying that more
data is going to yield a better,

23
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.150
more concentrated estimate around what
the sample variance is trying to estimate.

24
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.800
In this case, they're all trying to
estimate one cause they're sample from

25
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.590
a population with variance one.

26
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.300
Recall that earlier on in the lecture
we found that the variance of

27
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.534
a die roll was 2.92.

28
00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:40.460
So imagine if I were to roll ten dice.

29
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.990
And take the sample variance of
the numbers that were on sides facing up.

30
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.680
Then if I we're to take those ten dice and

31
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.790
repeat that process over and over and
over again, then I would get a very good

32
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.130
idea about the population distribution
of the variance of ten die rolls.

33
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.760
I would have to do it a lot, but
fortunately on the computer I

34
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.180
can do it thousands of times,
which is what I did right here.

35
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.500
And notice that the distribution of
the variance of ten die rolls is exactly

36
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.940
centered around 2.92, the variance of
the population of a single die roll.

37
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.399
And as I go to 20 and
30 it's still centered in the same place.

38
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.230
But it becomes more concentrated
about what it's trying to estimate.

39
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.110
What this is basically saying
is that the variance is

40
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.160
a good estimate of
the population variance.

41
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.440
That as we collect more data,

42
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.770
the distribution of the sample variance
gets more concentrated about what

43
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.880
it's trying to estimate and
that it's centered in the right place.

44
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.060
In other words, that it's unbiased.

45
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.380
This unbiasness is why we divide
by n minus 1 instead of n.

46
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.530
That makes it unbiased.
