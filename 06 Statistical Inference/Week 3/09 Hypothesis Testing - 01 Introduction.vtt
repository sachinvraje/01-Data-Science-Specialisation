00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.550
Hi, and welcome to the lecture
on hypothesis testing

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.500
as part of
the Statistical Inference Coursera class.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.000
My name is Brian Caffo and

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.492
this class is co-taught by my
co-instructors Jeff Leek and Roger Peng.

5
00:00:11.492 --> 00:00:14.068
We're all in the department
of Biostatistics at

6
00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:16.960
the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
of Public Health.

7
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.970
Given our existing work
on confidence intervals,

8
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.180
hypothesis testing will be
relatively easy to develop.

9
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.470
Hypothesis testing is concerned
with making decisions using data.

10
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.360
Typically, hypothesis testing starts with
a null hypothesis which is specified,

11
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.500
that represents the status quo.

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.672
It's usually labeled H0,
pronounced H naught.

13
00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:42.405
The null hypothesis, H naught,
is assumed to be true, and

14
00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:47.112
statistical evidence is required to
reject it in favor of an alternative or

15
00:00:47.112 --> 00:00:49.380
so-called research hypothesis.

16
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.290
Let's motivate hypothesis testing
with a straightforward example.

17
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.915
A respiratory disturbance index,
RDI, of more than 30 events per

18
00:00:56.915 --> 00:01:01.555
hour is considered evidence of
severe sleep disordered breathing.

19
00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:06.149
Suppose that in a sample of 100 overweight
subjects with other risk factors for sleep

20
00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.745
disordered breathing in a sleep clinic,
the mean RDI was 32 events per hour.

21
00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:13.790
So the sample mean RDI
was 32 events per hour,

22
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.100
with a standard deviation
of 10 events per hour.

23
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.020
We'd like to test whether or not
the population mean for this population

24
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.650
that we're drawing the sample from
is equal to 30, our benchmark for

25
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.790
severe sleep disordered breathing, or
whether or not it's larger than 30.

26
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.780
So we specify that as H0,
mu equal to 30, and

27
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.170
the alternative hypothesis,
Ha as mu greater than 30.

28
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.950
In our example, we specified Ha
that mu was greater than 30.

29
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.080
However it could've been less than, or

30
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.340
not equal to, depending on the research
hypothesis that we were interested in.

31
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.740
In that application,
we're specifically interested in whether

32
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.564
the respiratory disturbance index for
this population was larger than 30.

33
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.550
Notice that the truth is either
that H0 is true or Ha is true.

34
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.940
We could either decide Ho or decide Ha.

35
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.870
Therefore there's only four possibilities.

36
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.880
If the truth is Ho,

37
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.750
and we decide H0, we have simply
correctly accepted the null hypothesis.

38
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.340
If the truth is H0, and we decide Ha, we
have made what is called a Type I error.

39
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.425
In the version of hypothesis
testing that we're going present,

40
00:02:29.425 --> 00:02:32.510
we're going to control the probability
of a Type I error to be small.

41
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.390
If the truth is Ha and we conclude Ha,

42
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.660
we reject the null hypothesis,
then we've correctly rejected the null.

43
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.220
And if the truth is Ha, and we decide H0,
we've made what is called a Type II error.

44
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.990
The Type I error rate and
the Type II error rate are related

45
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.640
in the sense that as the Type I
error rate increases,

46
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.980
the Type II error rate decreases,
and vice versa.

47
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.690
We can illustrate this pretty easily
by considering a court of law.

48
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.133
In most courts,

49
00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:06.902
the null hypothesis is that the defendant
is innocent until proven guilty.

50
00:03:06.902 --> 00:03:11.040
Here, rejecting the null hypothesis
is to convict the defendant.

51
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.640
We're going to require evidence and

52
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.010
a standard on that evidence to
reject the null hypothesis.

53
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.410
If we set a very low standard, i.e.,

54
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.190
we don't require much in evidence to
convict people, then we're going to

55
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.058
increase the percentage of innocent people
convicted, Type I errors in this case.

56
00:03:31.058 --> 00:03:34.892
However, we would also increase
the percentage of guilty people convicted,

57
00:03:34.892 --> 00:03:37.750
which would be correctly
rejecting the null hypothesis.

58
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.084
If we set a very high standard, basically
a person has to have a smoking gun in

59
00:03:42.084 --> 00:03:46.150
their hand, to convict them,
then we would increase the percentage of

60
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.393
innocent people let free, a good thing,
correctly accepting the null.

61
00:03:50.393 --> 00:03:54.709
But we would also increase the percentage
of guilty people let free, or so called,

62
00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:55.730
Type II errors.

63
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.910
And this illustrates how the two,
the Type I error rate and

64
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.920
the Type II error rate, are related.

65
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.120
Of course ideally, what you would
like is to get better evidence for

66
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.160
a given standard.

67
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.813
And that's the idea of doing things
like increasing the sample size.

68
00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:13.257
But before we discuss
those sorts of issues,

69
00:04:13.257 --> 00:04:16.100
let's talk about how we
conduct hypothesis tests.
