00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.990
In R typing data sleep brings up the sleep
data that was originally analyzed in

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.350
Gosset's Biometrika paper.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.010
This shows the increase in hours slept for
patients onto sleep medications.

4
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.520
R treats the data as two groups,
rather than paired.

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.031
But here we're going to treat
the data is if they were paired.

6
00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:28.168
Here, data sleep will load the data.

7
00:00:28.168 --> 00:00:33.040
Head sleep will first, will print
the first few rows of the data frame.

8
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.255
Variable extra, is the extra hours slept.

9
00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:40.730
Group is a group ID,
and ID is a subject ID.

10
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.900
So, 1 through 10 will
give you subjects ID,

11
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.345
1 through 10 observation,
11 is subject ID 1 again, and so on.

12
00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:58.917
[SOUND] Here I plot the data,
and again the code for

13
00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:04.857
the plot can be found in
the R mark down file.

14
00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:07.530
I've connected each subject with a line.

15
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.150
I think it's pretty clear here,
the benefit from

16
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.600
acknowledging that these are repeat
measurements on the same subjects.

17
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.700
If you do not acknowledge that, then what
you are comparing is this variation,

18
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.480
group one variation, minus this variation,
group two variation.

19
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.990
If you do acknowledge that,
then you are comparing

20
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.350
these subject specific differences,
when comparing across groups.

21
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.793
But a variation in these differences is
much lower because observations within

22
00:01:45.793 --> 00:01:47.658
a subject are quite correlated.

23
00:01:54.461 --> 00:02:00.700
Here I grab the first ten measurements,
which are subjects 1 through 10.

24
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.080
And here I grab the latter
ten measurements,

25
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.620
which is subjects 1 through
10 on the second medication.

26
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.100
The difference then is
group 2 minus group 1.

27
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.370
Here, the vector y subdra,

28
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.480
subtraction making sense, because I
grabbed them in the specific order.

29
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.490
The mean of the difference is just mean,

30
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.630
and the standard deviation
of the difference can be

31
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.220
obtained with the function sd,
here I define n to be 10.

32
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.626
My t confidence interval
can be given like this.

33
00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:40.660
It is the mean plus or
minus the relevant t quantile,

34
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.250
evaluated at n minus 1 degrees of freedom
times the standard error of the interval.

35
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.050
Of course,
we don't want to do this every time, so

36
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.990
we can just do the function t
test of difference, and t test

37
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.920
where we pass it the two vectors, and
give it the argument paired equals true.

38
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.472
Or you can actually give it a form
of model statement where you say,

39
00:03:05.472 --> 00:03:10.430
outcome extra is a function of
the group where paired equals

40
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.610
true the value weighted for
the data frame sleep.

41
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.584
[SOUND] I formatted these
results a little bit,

42
00:03:20.584 --> 00:03:28.100
because it gives you much,
much, more output than this.

43
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.641
But I concatenated them into a matrix, and

44
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:34.602
you can see that all those commands
give you about the same result.

45
00:03:34.602 --> 00:03:39.820
The difference in the groups being
somewhere between 0.7 and 2.46.

46
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.690
So, because this is a confidence
interval the interpretation is,

47
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.150
that if we were to repeatedly perform
this procedure on independent samples,

48
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.280
about 95% of the intervals
that we obtained.

49
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.370
Would contain the true mean
difference that we're estimating.

50
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.655
This, of course, assumes that these
subjects are relevant sample from

51
00:03:59.655 --> 00:04:03.391
a population of subdec,
subjects that we're interested in.

52
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:06.799
Suppose
