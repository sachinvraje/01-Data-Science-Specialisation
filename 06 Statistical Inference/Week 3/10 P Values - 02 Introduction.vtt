Hi, my name is Brian Caffo, and this is
the lecture on p-values in the statistical

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.480
inference Coursera class as part of
our data science specialization.

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.190
This class is co-taught with my
c-instructors, Jeff Leek and

4
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.860
Roger Peng, we're all in
the department of Bio statistics

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.625
at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
of Public Health.

6
00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:22.070
P-values are the most common measure
of statistical significance.

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.170
Basically, every statistical software
that performs a hypothesis test

8
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.400
outputs a p-value for you.

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.910
And, because they're so popular, and
because often they get misinterpreted,

10
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.490
they are quite controversial
among statisticians.

11
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.690
And, so what I give here
are some comments both in favor,

12
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.090
of and some papers and
commentaries against P-value.

13
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.320
In this class, we're not going to focus
too much on these controversies, but

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.840
instead are just going to focus on
how do you generate a P-value and

15
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.180
how do you correctly interpret it?

16
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.520
The basic idea of a P-value is to start
under the null hypothesis assume that

17
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.190
nothing is going on, and then calculate
the probability of obtaining evidence as

18
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.720
or more extreme than we actually obtained
under this null hypothesis basically,

19
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.280
how unusual is the result we got
if the null hypothesis is true.

20
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.010
So let's go through the approach
through maybe three simple steps, and

21
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.810
then we'll go through basic
calculations in the next set of slides.

22
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.010
So first of all you get the hypothetical
distribution of a data summary,

23
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.110
which we'll just call a statistic like
our test statistic from the T lecture and

24
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.240
figure out its distribution
when nothing is going on,

25
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.630
the so-called null distribution
option of the statistic.

26
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.450
Then we calculate the statistic with
the data that we actually have so, for

27
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.690
example we calculate our T statistic
we actually plug in the empirical mean,

28
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.625
subtract off the hypothesized mean and
divide by the standard error.

29
00:01:48.135 --> 00:01:52.505
Then we calculate the probability
of obtaining a statistic as or

30
00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:56.715
more extreme in other words, we compare
what we calculated to our hypothetical

31
00:01:56.715 --> 00:02:01.445
distribution, and we see how extreme
it is, in toward the alternative.

32
00:02:02.485 --> 00:02:06.065
So, if the P-value is small, what you're
saying is the probability of observing

33
00:02:06.065 --> 00:02:11.690
a test statistic as extreme as we saw,
is low if the null hypothesis were true.

34
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.618
Okay, let's go over P-values with
a little bit more formality.

35
00:02:16.618 --> 00:02:21.120
So, the P-value is the probability
under the null hypothesis of

36
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.510
obtaining evidence as or
more extreme than was actually obtained.

37
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.740
So, and, and, we're, usually we're talking
about evidence here in terms of the test

38
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.180
statistic, so it's the probability
of obtaining a test statistic as or

39
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.770
more extreme in favor of the alternative
than was actually obtained.

40
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.830
So, if your P-value is small,
then either the null hypothesis is true,

41
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.370
and you've observed something that is
highly supportive of the alternative

42
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.810
that was quite unlikely, or
the null hypothesis is false.

43
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.580
So let's go through an exam- a quick,
just numerical example.

44
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.730
So, we've covered the T statistic,
and simple T test so

45
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.380
imagine if you wanted to test mu equal to
mu knot versus mu greater than mu not, and

46
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.060
our T statistic work got to be
2.5 on 15 degrees of freedom.

47
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.080
What is the probability
of getting a T statistic

48
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.840
as large as 2.5 under this,
in this scenario?

49
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.380
Well, here we can calculate
it it's just pt, 2.5 in 15,

50
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.340
15 for the degrees of freedom,
we want lower.tail = false because we

51
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.370
want the probability of being larger
than 2.5, right, as or more extreme

52
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.710
in the direction of the alternative and
that works out to be about 1%.

53
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.040
So therefore, the probability of
seeing evidence as or more extreme.

54
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.265
Then actually obtained under
the null hypothesis is one 1%, so

55
00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:58.001
either the null hypothesis is true,
and we've seen an exceptionally

56
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:01.630
large T statistic, or
the null hypothesis is false.

57
00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:08.647
So, there's another way to think about
the P-value as the so-called attained

58
00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:11.781
significance level, and
let's go through that really quickly.

59
00:04:11.781 --> 00:04:17.010
So we're calling through way an example
where our test statistic was two, for

60
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.990
H not mu equal to 30
versus mu greater than 30.

61
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.550
So test statistics larger
than two are,I,m sorry test

62
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.830
statistics that are larger
are going to be more supportive

63
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.460
of the alternative where two
here is two standard, or

64
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.340
that our test statistic is two standard
errors above the hypothesized mean of 30.

65
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.640
Let's assume that our test statistic
is standard normal, distributed

66
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.530
rather than T distributed just to make
our discussion a little bit easier.

67
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.916
Now if we were to set alpha equal to .05.

68
00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:56.329
We know that we would reject
because we know the point,

69
00:04:56.329 --> 00:05:01.970
the rejection region, and the quantile
that we would reject for at .05.

70
00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:12.309
So that, that area was 0.05 would be, the
quantile would be 1.645 since we know 2,

71
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.719
Since we know 2 lies above 1.645 we would,
we would reject.

72
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.765
Now imagine if instead of 0.05,
imagine if we did 0.04 then

73
00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:37.220
we would have another line that was
a little bit closer than 1.645.

74
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:44.670
So what if we were to find the exact error
rate where the line fell exactly on 2?

75
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.270
Well that would simply be
calculating this probability

76
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.560
right here of 2 or larger, and that's
nothing other than the P-value we just did

77
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.950
that calculation that's the probability
of getting a test statistic as large or

78
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.110
larger than 2 under the null hypothesis.

79
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.930
So at any rate another way to think about
the P-value, is its the smallest value for

80
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.180
alpha for which you would still
reject the null hypothesis.

81
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.350
And so because of that they call it
the attained significance level.

82
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.320
And what this means is that
the P-value is an extremely convenient

83
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.200
test statistic to communicate to people,
because when you give it to them,

84
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.069
they can test it versus whatever
alpha level they would like.

85
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.490
Let's reiterate some of the points
we made on the previous slide.

86
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.940
So by reporting a P-value your reader,

87
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.000
or whoever you're giving the P-value to,
to interpret it,

88
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.030
can perform the hypothesis test at
whatever alpha level he or she chooses to.

89
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.250
The simple rule is, if the P-value
is less than the alpha level,

90
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.310
then you reject a null hypothesis.

91
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.730
If the P-value is greater than it,
then you fail to reject.

92
00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.130
Now, we calculated our P-values for
one sided hypothesis test, T and Z test.

93
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.900
In order to get the two sided hypothesis
test, you have to account for

94
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.250
the evidence as or
more extreme too large or as or

95
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.440
more extreme to small negative so
because the equal

96
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.360
probability in either tail you'll
wind up doubling the P-value.

97
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:26.200
I would give a cautionary note that
the software automatically interprets for

98
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.470
most tests, automatically interprets the
two-sided test most of the time they'll

99
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.900
denote this as P-value for
a two-sided test.

100
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.154
But if they don't,
they're always calculating the P-value for

101
00:07:36.154 --> 00:07:37.270
the two-sided test.

102
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.000
The other thing I would know is that if
you happen to take some more advanced

103
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.830
classes in statistics that cover things
like Chi-squared test, those P-values

104
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.250
are automatically, in a sense, two-sided
you would not have to double them.
