00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.370
So, we actually covered an instance of
a p-value previously in the class, and

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.330
I wanted to go through it again now
that we know what p-values are.

3
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.120
So, suppose we're going to think
of gender assignment for kids,

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.290
that we're going to think of this for
a specific couple as if it's a coin flip.

5
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.140
Now, there's a lot of complexity to this
problem, and we're going to reduce it, but

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.870
let's just assume that it's a coin flip.

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.730
And what we're wondering,

8
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.450
because you have a friend that has, out of
eight kids, had seven girls, whether or

9
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.250
not the probability that that
coin lands on girl, right?

10
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.140
Let's say p is the probability
of having a girl

11
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.000
is equal to 0.5 versus greater than 0.5.

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.600
So the null hypothesis
is H0:p equal to 0.5.

13
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.720
And the alternative is
Ha:p greater than 0.5.

14
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.780
Well, under the null hypothesis,

15
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.520
we want to calculate the probability
of getting evidence as or more extreme.

16
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.750
Now, we don't know what a test, the test
statistic is in this case, but the most

17
00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.540
logical one is just to count the number
of girls out of the, out of the eight.

18
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.780
So, seven or eight would be as or
more extreme than was actually observed,

19
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.815
so the p value calculation is
the binomial calculation for

20
00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:16.815
7 plus the binomial calculation for 8,
under the null hypothesis where p is 0.5.

21
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.550
That works out to be about 3.5%.

22
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.000
I also go through the calculation here,

23
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.950
where I do pbinom instead of directly
plugging into the binomial formula,

24
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.545
and, of course, you get the same number.

25
00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:37.750
We, if we were testing that hypothesis,
we would reject at a 5% level.

26
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.737
We would reject at a 4% level, but

27
00:01:40.737 --> 00:01:45.040
we would not reject at
an type 1 error rate of 3%.

28
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.040
Now I would mention on this
specific problem, it's not obvious

29
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.570
what the two-sided p-value is,
so I'll give you a simple trick.

30
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.705
And the simple trick, in this case, is
to simply, if you wanted to test whether

31
00:01:58.705 --> 00:02:05.060
0.5 versus p different from 0.5, then you
just calculate the two one-sided p values.

32
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.770
In this case, the probability of being 7
or larger would be one one-sided p value,

33
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.330
and the probability of being 7 or smaller
would be the other one-sided p-values.

34
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.050
You take those two one-sided p values, you
take the smaller one, and you double it.

35
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.330
And that's the procedure for

36
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.770
getting a two-sided p value in these
binomial, exact binomial calculations.

37
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.820
Let's go through a poisson example.

38
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.242
So suppose that a hospital has
an infection rate of 10 infections per 100

39
00:02:35.242 --> 00:02:37.190
person days at risk, for

40
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.140
a rate of 0.1 infections per person day at
risk during their last monitoring period.

41
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.792
And, we want to assume
that the rate of 0.05

42
00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:54.490
infections per person day at
risk is an important benchmark.

43
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.780
If the rate goes above that
they would implement some

44
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.479
quality control procedures, let's say.

45
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.320
But you don't want to just have this,
this these expensive quality

46
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.910
control procedures go into place
just because of random fluctuation.

47
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.310
So you'd like to formally test
this hypothesis, accounting for

48
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.760
the uncertainty in the data in here
we're going to assume that the count,

49
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.260
the number of infections is Poisson.

50
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.610
Well, the null hypothesis then
is that lambda's 0.05 versus

51
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.970
the alternative that lambda is 0.,
greater that 0.05.

52
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.410
Or given that we're specifically talking
about 100 person days at risk for

53
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.560
this particular monitoring period, we
could think of this as the null hypothesis

54
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.330
is that the, the rate times 100 is 5,

55
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.100
versus the rate times
100 is greater than 5.

56
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.360
So what we want to know is, if in fact

57
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.680
the rate is 0.05 having been monitored for
100 person days at risk,

58
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.939
what's the probability of obtaining 10 or
more infections.

59
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.680
Okay, so this is a Poisson probability,
we want the upper tail,

60
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.120
so remember this little quirk of R.

61
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.930
If you want the upper tail and
you're doing a discreet distribution,

62
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.240
you actually have to drop
the number down by one.

63
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.494
So we're going to, P-P-O-I-S.

64
00:04:17.494 --> 00:04:20.550
So, ppois, for the ppois on probability.

65
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.800
We want to put in 9 because we want
the upper tail and because of this

66
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.420
issue that it does strictly greater
than for the upper direction.

67
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.450
Then the Poisson rate is 0.05 times
the 100 person days at risk, so 5.

68
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.540
And then we want to specify lower.tail
equals false, to make sure that we don't

69
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.070
get 9 and fewer, but we want strictly
greater than 9, which is 10 or more.

70
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.960
And that will give us
our realm of p-value.

71
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.780
So what is this probability?

72
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.660
This is the probability of obtaining 10 or
more infections if, in fact, the true

73
00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.810
rate of infections we've should've seen
on a 100 person days at risk is 5, okay?

74
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.230
And it turns out that that's
a relatively low probability.

75
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.470
It's unlikely for

76
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.938
us to have seen as many as 10 infections
for a 100 person days at risk.

77
00:05:09.938 --> 00:05:12.680
So only 3% chance of that occurring,
if, in fact,

78
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.150
the real infection was 5 for
a 100 person days at risk.

79
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.459
So this hospital perhaps should execute
those quality control procedures.

80
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.850
So hopefully what you've gotten out of
this lecture, is that the way that you

81
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.370
calculate a p value, is you calculate
the probability of obtaining

82
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.960
data as or more extreme than you actually
obtained in favor of the alternative,

83
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.590
where the probability calculation
is done under the null.

84
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.000
And all the p values are done this way and
I think what we, what we saw was we saw

85
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.910
the the kind of formal rules that you
could execate, execute in the z and

86
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.750
the t test which are, are kind of easy,
but then we our way through some of these

87
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.720
other examples like the binomial
example and the Poisson example.
