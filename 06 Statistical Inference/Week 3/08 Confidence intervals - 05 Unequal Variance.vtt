00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.420
So hopefully the formula for

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.630
the unequal variance case
looks pretty familiar to you.

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.280
It's the difference in the means plus or

4
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.498
minus a t quantile times
the standard error.

5
00:00:16.498 --> 00:00:20.350
The standard error is calculated
assuming there's a different variance in

6
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.219
each of the two groups.

7
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.520
It turns out that if the x observations
and the y observations are IID normal,

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.540
potentially with different means and
potentially with different variances,

9
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.960
the relevant normalized statistic
does not follow a t distribution.

10
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.030
Instead, it can be approximated
by a t distribution,

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.910
where we choose a rather elaborate
formula for the degrees of freedom.

12
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.030
Now no one remembers this degrees
of freedom calculation, and it's a,

13
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.060
it's a very odd calculation because it
just doesn't involve the sample sizes, but

14
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.415
actually the estimated standard deviations
and variances from the two groups.

15
00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:12.930
Nonetheless, if you plug in this
potentially fractional degrees of freedom,

16
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.030
you get a t calculation that very closely
approximates the relevant distribution,

17
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.930
which is not actually a t distribution,
and

18
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.290
it turns out that it works well enough
that I can give the statement that

19
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.590
when you're in doubt just use
the unequal variance interval.

20
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.990
On this page, I simply show churning
through the calculations for

21
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.320
the oral contraceptive
example from earlier.

22
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.460
You might want to go through this
calculation just so you can at once

23
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.970
convince yourself that you can plug
into the standard deviation formula,

24
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.822
particularly, the degrees of freedom
that you get in this case is 15.04.

25
00:01:55.822 --> 00:02:00.849
Nonetheless, typically when we
want unequal variance t tests,

26
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.100
we simply use the r command t.test
with var.equal equals FALSE,

27
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.400
and that'll do the relevant t
test with unequal variances and

28
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.210
produce the reletant, relevant t
quantile with unequal variances.

29
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.850
So let's summarize what
we talked about today.

30
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.550
We talked about creating intervals
using the t distribution,

31
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.940
some of the handiest intervals
in all of statistics.

32
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.370
When we have single observations or
paired observations for which we've taken

33
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.040
the difference, we use the t interval
to create intervals that are highly

34
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.240
robust to the underlying assumptions
regarding the distribution of the data.

35
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.430
However, we have talked about a couple of
cases where it's probably preferable to

36
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.740
use something other than the t
distribution and t intervals.

37
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.500
For example, we talked about
when the data are highly skewed,

38
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.620
you may either want to take a log,
or look for different procedures.

39
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.500
In addition, when your data is binary,

40
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.350
you might consider something like looking
at odds ratios, which we will cover

41
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.820
in our generalized linear model
component of the regression class.

42
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.600
The same can be said for count data,
where we'll talk about Poisson models and

43
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.049
generalized linear models for rates,
again in our regression class.

44
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.700
For several of the other
two-group special cases, the class

45
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.930
Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp 2,
also on Coursera, covers many of them.
