Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.500
This is a 2 minute tutorial on using
Knitr.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.160
You need a little bit of Knitr to create
your art

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.870
project that you will hand in as part of
the assignments.

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.316
So let's, I've got RStudio open here,
hopefully

6
00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:18.975
you can see it and, I want to go File,

7
00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:21.244
so Alt-F and New File, and then as

8
00:00:21.244 --> 00:00:26.610
you look, there's all these different
options here, probably.

9
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.070
I'm in RStudio, by the way.

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.670
And there's all these different options
here.

11
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.350
You want to go down to R Markdown.

12
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.150
There we go.

13
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.900
And it actually populates a simple Knitr
document.

14
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.360
So I'm going to edit the title.

15
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.850
I just want to say, this is a, is a test
Knitr document.

16
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.510
Okay, and there's a bunch of text there.

17
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.410
And it shows you the R command R commands
here.

18
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.765
So what you need is you need three little
forward, well I, I don't

19
00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:10.060
know if there are right tick marks here or
right quotation marks.

20
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.400
You know one's slanted from the upper left
to the lower right,

21
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.570
so the key at least on my keyboard that's
right below escape.

22
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.530
And then you need a, if you put an r here
in this little area, it will

23
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.020
it will execute R code, and the comma
after

24
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.780
the R will open up a bunch of options.

25
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.649
So there's a ton of Knitr options, but
cache tells R whether or not to keep it.

26
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.990
Probably the most useful ones for me, eval

27
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.050
tells whether or not is should evaluate
the code.

28
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.580
Sometimes you might just want to show code
in your document.

29
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.459
These are all figure things.

30
00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:58.670
[BLANK_AUDIO]

31
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.671
Results equals, so the, so you can have
results

32
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:07.070
as marked up, which show syntax
highlighting as is.

33
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.660
Hide will hide the results and I find that
most, most useful.

34
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.460
Probably the other one that's most useful
for me is echo.

35
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.550
So you have echo as true or false.

36
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.240
It, echo, true shows the code, and then
also shows the results of the code.

37
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.275
Echo false does not show the code.

38
00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:30.191
[SOUND] Okay.

39
00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:33.360
So any rate, so here's our, here's our
examples.

40
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.400
Here, here's a, gives an example of a plot
too, so plot cars, okay?

41
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.870
So let's save this.

42
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.960
Oop.

43
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.950
And this is I need to save it as
something.

44
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.065
So let's put test.Rmd, okay?

45
00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:55.700
And then I go control, well, so I need to
make sure that, that Knitr is,

46
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.290
is loaded, but actually there's a little
button right here that you can just do.

47
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.450
I on this tiny computer so it's hard to
see,

48
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.140
but you can just actually click Knit HTML
right there.

49
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.430
And there it will knit it.

50
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.060
And there you can see how it, kind of what
it looks like.

51
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.900
And it, and it creates an HTML document.

52
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.550
So if I were for example to do dir in

53
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.310
R, you can see that it's created this
test.html document.

54
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.120
That, that's a, that's just a standard
HTML document.

55
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.446
You could do browse.url, browseURL,
browseURL test.html, and

56
00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:40.590
it'll bring up, it'll bring up a browser
window with it in, within it.

57
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.330
Okay, so that's Knitr in a nutshell.
