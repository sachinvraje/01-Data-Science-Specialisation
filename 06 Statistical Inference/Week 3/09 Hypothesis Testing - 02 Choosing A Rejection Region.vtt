1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.760
This test.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.620
Consider our respiratory
disturbance index example again.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.350
A reasonable strategy, would be to reject
the null hypothesis of our sample mean

4
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.940
respiratory disturbance index
was larger than some constant.

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.830
Let's label that constant C.

6
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.880
C will take into account
the variability of X bar.

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.470
Typically, C is chosen so that
the probability of a type one error rate,

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.965
this probability label is a low number.

9
00:00:30.965 --> 00:00:35.360
5% has emerged as sort of
a benchmark in hypothesis testing.

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.590
So to repeat, alpha,
is the type one error rate.

11
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.880
Which in other words is, the probability
of rejecting the null hypothesis when,

12
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.880
in fact, the null hypothesis is correct.

13
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.250
That's a bad thing, you don't
want to make these kind of mistakes.

14
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.230
But as in our court of law example,
you don't want to set this rate too low,

15
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.560
because then we would never
reject a null hypothesis.

16
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.150
Let's see if we can choose
this constant C, so

17
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.185
that the probability we would reject
is simply tolerably low, say 5%.

18
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.500
The standard error of the mean is 10,

19
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.790
the assumed standard
deviation of the population.

20
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.900
And here we haven't drawn a distinction
as to whether we estimate, or

21
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.610
this is just a number that I've given you.

22
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.350
Divided by square root 100,

23
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.660
that's the square root of the sample size,
that works out to be 1.

24
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.782
Here I just created the settings, so
it completely worked out to be 1.

25
00:01:34.238 --> 00:01:38.110
Under the null hypothesis where
under H not mute is equal to 30,

26
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.200
the distribution of the sample mean
X bar is normal with a mean of 30,

27
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.640
and a variance of one which we just
calculated as the standard error square of

28
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.960
the standard error of
the mean in the line above.

29
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.880
So, we want to choose the constant C.

30
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.230
So that the probability that
X bar is larger than C,

31
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.460
under the null hypothesis is 5%.

32
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.075
So remember the 95th percentile of
the standard normal distribution is

33
00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:08.330
1.645 standard deviations from the mean.

34
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.370
So, if we set the constant as
1.645 standard deviations,

35
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.360
from the mean under the null hypothesis.

36
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.251
We will have achieved a cup point, so
that the probability that a randomly drawn

37
00:02:21.251 --> 00:02:24.615
mean from this population
is larger than this is 5%.

38
00:02:42.534 --> 00:02:48.214
So in this case it's 30, the hypothesized
mean under the null hypothesis, plus 1,

39
00:02:48.214 --> 00:02:53.667
the standard error of the mean times
1.645, the number of standard deviations

40
00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:59.330
from the mean that we're considering which
in this case works out to be 31.645.

41
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.520
So, just to reiterate, the probability
that a normal 30 with a mean of 30,

42
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.580
and a variance of 1,
is larger than this constant is 5%.

43
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.710
So the rule,
reject the null hypothesis when

44
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.150
you receive an average larger
than 31.645 has the property.

45
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.969
That we will reject 5% of the time
when the null hypothesis is true.

46
00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:30.466
Again, 5% of the time in the instances
where the sample size is exactly a 100,

47
00:03:30.466 --> 00:03:33.889
and the standard deviation of
the population is exactly 10.

48
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.790
In the previous slide, we reverted
the calculation of the rejection region

49
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.610
C back to the original units of the data.

50
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.730
However, I hope you got the gist
from the problem that basically,

51
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.955
whenever you are testing greater than,
if the sample mean is more than

52
00:03:51.955 --> 00:03:56.920
1.645 standard errors from the mean, from
the hypothesized mean, you would reject.

53
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.660
And there is nothing particular about 30,
and the standard error of the mean of 1.

54
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.920
So, instead of

55
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.350
calculating this constant back on units of
the original data, we tend to convert our

56
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.200
sample mean into however many standard
errors from the hypothesized mean it is.

57
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.800
So, take this specific example.

58
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.290
If our observed sample mean was 32,
our hypothesized mean is 30,

59
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.565
and our standard error is 10 divided
by square root of 100, we're in a real.

60
00:04:27.565 --> 00:04:30.625
Problem if 10 would be
estimated from the data.

61
00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:34.215
So, be the sample standard deviation,
this works out to be 2.

62
00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:40.932
This is greater than 1.645 the chance
of this occurring is less than 5%.

63
00:04:40.932 --> 00:04:42.992
So we're going to reject
the null hypothesis.

64
00:04:42.992 --> 00:04:46.102
I, I should reiterate that
the chance of this occurring,

65
00:04:46.102 --> 00:04:48.802
under the null hypothesis is less than 5%.

66
00:04:48.802 --> 00:04:51.192
So, we're going to reject
the null hypothesis,

67
00:04:51.192 --> 00:04:54.102
in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

68
00:04:54.102 --> 00:04:58.110
So, I've just simply written out this
rule again here on the final line.

69
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.500
We're going to reject whenever X
bar minus the hypothesized mean,

70
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.650
divided by the standard error of the mean,
is grater than

71
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.590
the appropriate upper quantile that
leaves Alpha percent in the upper tail.
