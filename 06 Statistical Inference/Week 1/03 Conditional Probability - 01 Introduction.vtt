00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.350
Hi, and welcome to the conditional
probability lecture as part of

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.920
the statistical inference class in
the Coursera data design specialization.

3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.830
So conditioning is wonderfully
illustrated by this XKCD comic here.

4
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.180
In this case two people are standing
out in a field right near a tree in

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.960
the middle of a lightning storm, and
one of them says we should go inside.

6
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.630
The other one says, well, the chance of

7
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.790
getting hit by lightning is only about
one in seven million so we're fine.

8
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.890
And the tagline is that
the death rate among people who

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.310
know the statistic is one in six.

10
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.900
And what the comic is highlighting is
that this person hasn't conditioned on

11
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.440
what they know, right.

12
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.320
In this case if you were to
condition on the death rate for

13
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.110
lightning strikes among people who
are standing in fields in lightning

14
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.780
storms near a tree would be much
higher than one in seven million.

15
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.470
Let's go through another example,
so a simple, conceptual example.

16
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.230
So the probability of getting a one
when rolling a standard die is

17
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.400
assumed to be one-sixth.

18
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.740
Suppose that you were given
the extra information that

19
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.150
the die roll was an odd number,
hence a one, three, or five.

20
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.340
So, someone rolled the die in
a way that you couldn't see, and

21
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.130
they told you that a one,
three, or a five occurred.

22
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.220
Conditional on this new information,

23
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.480
you would not say the probability
of a one is one-sixth anymore.

24
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.720
You would now say it's one-third,
equally likely between the one, the three,

25
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.710
or the five.

26
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.960
And that's what conditional
probabilities are giving you.

27
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.370
And of course, they have a definition.

28
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.687
So let's let B be the event,

29
00:01:36.687 --> 00:01:40.750
be an event, such that the probability
of B is greater than zero.

30
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.860
And this is important
because there's no sense in

31
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.109
conditioning on an event
that can't happen.

32
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.120
Then the conditional probability
of an event A given that B has

33
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.350
occurred is written like this.

34
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.390
The probability of A,
little horizontal line, B.

35
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.080
So this read probability of A given
the event that B has occurred is equal to

36
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.309
the probability of the intersection
divided by the probability of B.

37
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.190
And we haven't talked about independence
yet, but in the event that A and

38
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.730
B are unrelated or so called statistically
independent, which we'll define later,

39
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.030
than the probability of A given B,
works out to just be the probability of A.

40
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.679
So the new information that B
has occurred have given you no

41
00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:25.790
information about the probability
of law governing the event A.

42
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.380
So let's just check that conditional
probability gives us the answer that

43
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.340
we know to be true in the die rolling,
case.

44
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.930
So in our case B was the event one,
three, five.

45
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.330
A was the event one.

46
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.380
We want the probability of the event A,
conditional on the event one, three, or

47
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.880
five having occurred.

48
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.200
So, in other words,
we can say probability of getting a one,

49
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.500
given that we know that
the roll is an odd number.

50
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.840
That's the probability of A given B,

51
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.990
which is the probability of A intersect
B over the probability of B.

52
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.920
In this case,
A happens to lie entirely within B, so

53
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.950
the probability of A intersect
B is just the probability of A.

54
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.460
So that works out to be one-sixth,
and then the probability of B

55
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.646
in the denominator works out
to be three-sixths, right.

56
00:03:14.646 --> 00:03:18.670
One-sixth for each of the three
mutually exclusive possibilities,

57
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.180
which works out to be one-third, which
is what we knew had to be the answer.
