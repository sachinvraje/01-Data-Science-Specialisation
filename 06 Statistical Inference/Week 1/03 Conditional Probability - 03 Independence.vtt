00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.992
Let's cover briefly
the subject of independence.

2
00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:09.464
We alluded to this earlier,
in that we said that A is independent of B

3
00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:13.541
if the probability of A given B
is equal to the probability A for

4
00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:16.381
an event B that has positive probability.

5
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:20.408
Another definition of independence is
that the prob, A and B are independent if

6
00:00:20.408 --> 00:00:25.620
the probability of A intersect B works out
to be the product of their probabilities.

7
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.130
This then begins a very important lesson.

8
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.980
You can't just multiply
probabilities willy-nilly.

9
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.550
You have to multiply independent prob,

10
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.336
probabilities associated with
the independence events.

11
00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:39.900
Let's go thru a numerical example.

12
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.060
What is the probability of
getting two consecutive heads?

13
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.704
Well, let's define A as the probability
of getting a head on flip one and

14
00:00:46.704 --> 00:00:49.127
B as the probability of
getting a head on flip two.

15
00:00:49.127 --> 00:00:50.900
Both probabilities are 0.5.

16
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.850
In this case, we're assuming a fair coin.

17
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.870
A intersect B is the event of
getting heads on flips one and two.

18
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.560
In this case, because the events
are independent the probability of

19
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.170
A intersect B is the product
of the probabilities.

20
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.490
And so we would say that it's 0.25.

21
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.490
People do this calculation
rather naturally.

22
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.810
The problem is when people multiply
probabilities when they shouldn't.

23
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.250
A particularly stark instance
of incorrectly multiplying

24
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.870
probabilities occurred in volume 309
of science, which was reporting on

25
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.720
a physician who was on trial for giving
expert testimony in a criminal trial.

26
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.910
The criminal trial involved
a mother who had two

27
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.600
children die from sudden
infant death syndrome.

28
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.190
The expert testimony took the prevalence
of seven, in sudden infant death syndrome

29
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.270
as one out of 8,500, and then multiplied
them together to find the probability

30
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.570
of two children having sudden infant
death syndrome with the same mother.

31
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.720
Based on this evidence, and

32
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.519
I presume other evidence, the mother
on trial was convicted of murder.

33
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.530
Relevant to this class,
the principle mistake was to is,

34
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.150
to multiply probabilities for events
that were not necessarily independent.

35
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.452
And it makes sense that in this case
to assume that the events would be

36
00:02:13.452 --> 00:02:17.079
dependent because any biological
process that has a genetic or

37
00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.677
familial environmental component is
likely to be dependent within families.

38
00:02:21.677 --> 00:02:26.140
In this class, the main way we're going to
use independence is that we're going to

39
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.650
assume that a collection of random
variables are independent and

40
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.690
from the same distribution.

41
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.160
Recall such random variables independent
and identically distributed.

42
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.530
So you might think of several coin flips
as IID because they're independent.

43
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.960
One coin flip is independent to,
from the next one.

44
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.074
And they all rise from the same
distribution, 0.5 for heads and

45
00:02:46.074 --> 00:02:47.259
0.5 for tails.

46
00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:51.440
IID sampling is our default model for
a random sample.

47
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.653
So whether we have an actual random sample
or not, we often use random sampling or

48
00:02:56.653 --> 00:03:00.659
I, the model of IID as a conceptual
model to analyze our data.

49
00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.240
It'll be our principal mode
of analysis for this class.
