00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.390
In contrast to the probability mass
function, which assigns probabilities to

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.750
specific values for discrete random
variables is the probability

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.730
density function, which is associated
with continuous random variables.

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.700
Just like a probability mass function has
specific rules that it has to follow,

5
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.570
a probability density function has
specific rules that it has to follow.

6
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.678
Specifically, to be a valid
probability density function,

7
00:00:25.678 --> 00:00:29.276
a function must satisfy being larger
than or equal to zero everywhere.

8
00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:32.667
And, then the total area
under it must be one.

9
00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:36.530
And, then here is the basic rule
of a probability density function.

10
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.110
Areas under probability density functions
correspond to probabilities for

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.000
that random variable.

12
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.250
So for example, if I say
intelligence quotients are normally

13
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.020
distributed with a mean of 100 and
a standard deviation of 15,

14
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.148
that implies that the population follows
a specific bell shaped looking curve.

15
00:00:54.148 --> 00:00:57.720
And I am assuming that
the probability that I draw sam-,

16
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.000
that the probability, if I were to draw a
sample, the probability that a person from

17
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.070
that sample has an IQ between 100 and say,
a hundred, 115, is this area right here.

18
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.970
Note again, our probability density
function is a statement about

19
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.970
the population of intelligence
quotients in this case.

20
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.120
It's not a statement
about the data itself.

21
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.000
Again, we're going to use the data
to evaluate that assumption and

22
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.630
to evaluate statements about
the population probability.

23
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.900
But inherently whenever you
say the word probability,

24
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.989
you are talking about
a population quantity.

25
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.940
Interestingly note when we model
continuous probabilities like this,

26
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.800
or probabilities for continuous random
variables like this, the probability that

27
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.640
it takes any specific value is in fact
zero because the area of a line is zero.

28
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.240
This isn't a problem.

29
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.750
This is just a quirk from modeling
random variables as if they

30
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.380
have infinite precision, but it doesn't
gum up the works in any way at all.

31
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.880
It turns out that the bell shaped curve is
a rather difficult density to work with.

32
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.010
At least until you learn how, which we're
going to be doing in a separate lecture.

33
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.445
So let's work with a much
simpler density right now,

34
00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:16.373
specifically one that looks
just like a right triangle.

35
00:02:16.373 --> 00:02:21.277
So f of x equals 2x for
x between 0 and 1, and 0 otherwise.

36
00:02:21.277 --> 00:02:23.150
And let's give some context around it.

37
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.320
Let's say it's the proportion of help
calls that get addressed in a random day

38
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.880
by a help line is given by this.

39
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.450
So what does this mean?

40
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.502
This means that the probability
that between 20% and

41
00:02:34.502 --> 00:02:40.030
60% of the calls get addressed
that day is given by this area.

42
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.810
Let's ask the question,
is this a mathematically valid density?

43
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.590
I plotted the probability
density function right here.

44
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.290
It looks like a right triangle.

45
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.890
Notice the R code is given here,
and is given in the lecture slides

46
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.930
itself because the slides are created
using the slidify format.

47
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.620
So it's important to actually use
git to pull the course repository.

48
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.775
And you can actually look in the rmd,
or R markdown file, and

49
00:03:08.775 --> 00:03:13.273
get all of the code for all of
the examples for all of the lectures.

50
00:03:13.273 --> 00:03:15.291
So at any rate,
we need to discuss whether or

51
00:03:15.291 --> 00:03:19.071
not this probability density function is
a valid probability density function.

52
00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:22.540
Notice, it's always bigger than or
equal to zero.

53
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.416
And then secondly,
let's calculate its area.

54
00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:28.446
Well, that's not too hard
because it's a right triangle.

55
00:03:28.446 --> 00:03:31.860
One half the area of the base,
right, which is one half,

56
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.791
times the height, which is 2.

57
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:35.659
So one half times 2 is 1.

58
00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.098
So the area is 1.

59
00:03:37.098 --> 00:03:41.340
So in fact, this is a valid
probability density function.

60
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.120
Let's go through an example
of working with this density.

61
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.100
What's the probability that 75% or

62
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.830
fewer calls get addressed in a randomly
sampled day from this population?

63
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.848
Well, it turns out quite nice that this
is just another right triangle that we

64
00:03:56.848 --> 00:03:57.951
need to figure out.

65
00:03:57.951 --> 00:04:02.518
So the height at this point is 1.5,
because remember the function is just 2

66
00:04:02.518 --> 00:04:06.949
times x, so at the point,
point se, 0.75, the height is 1.5.

67
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:12.186
And then of course,
the value of the, the base is 0.75.

68
00:04:12.186 --> 00:04:15.033
But then we divide it by 2 because
it's one-half the area of the base

69
00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:15.830
times the height.

70
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.800
And that works out to be 56%,
as shown right here.

71
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.510
It turns out that this density is actually
a special case of a known density,

72
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.410
called the beta distribution.

73
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.860
And I give you the R code here for

74
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.170
directly getting this probability
from the beta distribution.

75
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.270
Of course, we don't need it,
because it's just working with triangles.

76
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.970
However, in more complicated settings,
we're going to need these functions.

77
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.180
I want to add that the word,

78
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.060
the letter p, in front of
a function asks for probabilities.

79
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.014
So pbeta is going to ask for

80
00:04:47.014 --> 00:04:52.396
the probability from a beta
density of being less than 0.75.

81
00:04:52.396 --> 00:04:56.660
Here the 2 and the 1 are the specific
parameters that turn it into the exact

82
00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.814
triangle that we're using right here, and
you see that you get the same number, 56%.

83
00:05:01.814 --> 00:05:05.518
Certain areas of the density are so
useful we give them names.

84
00:05:05.518 --> 00:05:10.040
For example, the cumulative distribution
function of a random variable x, returns

85
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.017
the probability that a random variable
is less than or equal to the value x.

86
00:05:14.017 --> 00:05:19.627
So it returns the probability capital
X is less than or equal to little x.

87
00:05:19.627 --> 00:05:23.826
And this definition applies whether
x is discrete or continuous.

88
00:05:23.826 --> 00:05:27.244
So remember in our beta distribution
that we just looked at,

89
00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:31.264
the pbeta function in R always returns
whatever the first argument is,

90
00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:34.590
the probability of being less than or
equal to that.

91
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.610
So in fact whenever you
do pdensity name in R,

92
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.430
it is actually just returning
the cumulative distribution function.

93
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.990
The survival function is sometimes
interesting to work with instead of

94
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.720
the distribution function, and it's
just 1 minus the distribution function.

95
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.120
So, instead of the probability
of being less than,

96
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.410
it's the probability
of being greater than.

97
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.390
So imagine if we wanted the cumulative
distribution function of the density

98
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.800
considered before.

99
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.040
Say for example, we wanted to know
what's the probability that 40% or

100
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.280
fewer of the calls get
answered in a given day?

101
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.490
What's the probability that 50% or fewer
of the calls get answered in a given day?

102
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.480
And what's the probability that 60% or

103
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.518
fewer of the calls get
answered in a given day.

104
00:06:15.518 --> 00:06:18.430
Given the particular model
that we have right now,

105
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.840
which is this right triangle as a
population, probability density function.

106
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.295
Well, for any of those numbers,
just looking at the picture,

107
00:06:27.295 --> 00:06:30.800
it's going to be very similar to 0.7,
how we figured it out for 0.75.

108
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.166
It's going to be a right triangle, so

109
00:06:32.166 --> 00:06:35.000
it's going to be one-half the area
of the base times the height.

110
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.960
That's always going to be one-half x,
whatever x you're plugging in, times 2x,

111
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.360
the height at that point,
which works out to be x squared.

112
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.970
So the function x squared takes the number
that you're want to evaluate and

113
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.180
gives the probability of
that percent of calls or

114
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.620
fewer getting answered on
a randomly sampled day.

115
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.276
Okay.
So we see that here when plug in pbeta,

116
00:06:57.276 --> 00:07:01.623
which is our cumulative distribution
function in R for these three values.

117
00:07:01.623 --> 00:07:05.666
The 2 and the 1 make it so that we're
evaluating the specific beta density.

118
00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:10.276
And that works out to 16%, 25% and 36%.

119
00:07:10.276 --> 00:07:16.086
So, on 16, so
the probability that 40% of the calls or

120
00:07:16.086 --> 00:07:20.398
fewer get answered on a given day is 16%.

121
00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:25.124
The probability that 50% of the calls or
fewer get answered on a given day is 25%.

122
00:07:25.124 --> 00:07:27.896
And the probability that
60% of the calls or

123
00:07:27.896 --> 00:07:30.560
fewer on a given day get answered is 36%.

124
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.300
If you wanted the survivor function,

125
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.980
it's 1 minus the cumulative distribution
function, so it's 1 minus x squared.

126
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.510
In the future we're going to have, work
with more complicated density functions,

127
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.860
but it'll actually be easier, because
we'll just be relying, for example, on

128
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.670
the pnorm and pbeta function, like this,
instead of directly figuring them out.

129
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.681
You've already heard of sample quantiles.

130
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:54.952
For example,
if you score into the 95th percentile,

131
00:07:54.952 --> 00:07:58.013
which is the 0.95th quantile on an,
on an exam,

132
00:07:58.013 --> 00:08:02.622
know that 95% of the students scored
worse than you and 5% scored better.

133
00:08:02.622 --> 00:08:04.880
These are the so called sample quantiles.

134
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.350
We're going to define
their population analogs.

135
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.870
So remember in the sample quantile, if
you want to define the 95th percentile or

136
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.830
the 0.95 quantile,

137
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.380
what you would do is line
the observations from least to greatest.

138
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.106
And you would find the exam score or
the point,

139
00:08:20.106 --> 00:08:23.040
such that 95% of
the observation lie below it.

140
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.500
The alphath quantile of the distribution
function with distribution function F is

141
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.880
the point x sub alpha such that
F of x of alpha equals alpha.

142
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.410
That's quite a tongue twister, so
let's see if we can draw a picture.

143
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.888
If we were to draw a density, F of x,

144
00:08:38.888 --> 00:08:44.037
the distribution function evaluated at x,
is the area below the point x.

145
00:08:44.037 --> 00:08:48.570
Which is the probability that a random
variable from this population is

146
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.560
less than or equal to x.

147
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.060
So you might think of it as
a population of test scores.

148
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.710
And it's a infinite
population of students.

149
00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.260
And here, this would be
the probability of getting a score for

150
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.672
a randomly drawn student from
this population of x or lower.

151
00:09:03.672 --> 00:09:08.550
The alphath quantile is we
move this line around until we

152
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:13.670
find the point x sub alpha, so that
exactly alpha probability lies below it.

153
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.467
That is exactly what we are doing with our
data when we find an empirical quantile.

154
00:09:17.467 --> 00:09:20.293
We keep finding the data points such that,
for

155
00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:23.370
example, 95% of the test
scores lie below it.

156
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.720
That would be the sample 95th percentile.

157
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.405
Now we move the x point along until we
find the point such the probability of

158
00:09:29.405 --> 00:09:33.710
lying below it is 95% in this
population distribution.

159
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.930
Again, the percentile is simply
a quantile with alpha expressed as

160
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.810
a percent instead of a proportion.

161
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.130
And the median is the per,

162
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.370
perhaps the most well known quantile,
is the 50th percentile.

163
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.660
We're going to use quantiles a lot,
so it's worth reinforcing this point.

164
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.600
So the 95th percentile of a population
distribution is the point,

165
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.500
such that the probability a random
variable is drawn from that

166
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.100
population is less than that value is 95%.

167
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:04.700
And the probability that a random variable
drawn from that population is more is 5%.

168
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.940
Let's work through our previous example.

169
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.780
What is the median of the distribution
that we were working with before?

170
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.693
Remember that the distribution
looked like a right triangle.

171
00:10:13.693 --> 00:10:17.360
In the distribution function,
for example if wanted to

172
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.821
find the probability that x proportion of
calls got answered on a given day or less,

173
00:10:22.821 --> 00:10:27.907
that F of x, that distribution function,
worked out to simply be x squared.

174
00:10:27.907 --> 00:10:31.944
Where x has to be a value between 0 and
1 for it to make sense.

175
00:10:31.944 --> 00:10:36.517
In this case, we want to solve 0.5 equals
F of x, which is equal to x squared.

176
00:10:36.517 --> 00:10:39.077
Resulting in the solution square root 0.5.

177
00:10:39.077 --> 00:10:41.855
This is 0.7.

178
00:10:41.855 --> 00:10:46.898
So what this means is that
on about 50% of the days,

179
00:10:46.898 --> 00:10:51.729
70% of the phone calls,
or fewer get answered.

180
00:10:51.729 --> 00:11:00.368
And on about 50% of the days, about 70%
of the phone calls or more get answered.

181
00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:05.803
We work with quantiles a lot, especially
quantiles from the normal distribution.

182
00:11:05.803 --> 00:11:09.681
We almost never go through this process
of working directly with the densities to

183
00:11:09.681 --> 00:11:13.389
calculate quantiles, because the
distributions we work with are common and

184
00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:15.580
this has already been done for us.

185
00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.330
In R, there's an easy tri-,

186
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.720
trick.

187
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.120
Basically, q in front
of the function name,

188
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.870
function density name,
gives the quantiles.

189
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.530
So in this case,
we know that this is a beta density.

190
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.150
Well, we don't know.

191
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.100
I'm telling you that
this is a beta density.

192
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.120
And so
qbeta gives us the relevant quantile.

193
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.860
Here we plug in 0.5.

194
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.970
And remember R takes the argument
of the quantile as a proportion.

195
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.800
So, if you plug in 0.5, it will work.

196
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.914
If you plug 50 for 50%, it will not work.

197
00:11:44.914 --> 00:11:45.832
Okay, and the 2 and

198
00:11:45.832 --> 00:11:48.919
the 1 are the parameters that we
haven't really fully described.

199
00:11:48.919 --> 00:11:52.293
But that you are going to have to
just take my word for it that those

200
00:11:52.293 --> 00:11:56.660
are the parameters that yield the specific
data density that we're looking at.

201
00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:01.099
And when we plug this in, we get 0.7,
0.71, exactly like we got before.

202
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.110
You might be wondering, at this point,
I've heard of a median before,

203
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.550
but it wasn't as complicated.

204
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.620
I just ordered my observations from least
to greatest and took the middle, or

205
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.890
the average of the two middle observations
if I had an even number of observations.

206
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.570
There you had a sample quantity.

207
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:19.790
It's an estimator.

208
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.000
In this class, we're going to
build up not just estimators but

209
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.160
the targets of estimation or the estimand.

210
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.770
So in this case, your sample median
is estimating your population median.

211
00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:31.580
So for example,

212
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:36.320
a sample median from our previous example
is if we were to sample a couple of days,

213
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.070
calculate the percentage of calls that
got answered on that, of those days,.

214
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:44.508
Line up those percentages, and take
the middle one, that would be the median.

215
00:12:44.508 --> 00:12:50.110
We would think of that as a target as a,
as an estimator of a population.

216
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:54.320
Sort of a true median percentage
of calls that get answered.

217
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.084
And there's, of course, a lot of
assumptions that we're going to need to

218
00:12:58.084 --> 00:13:00.493
make to connect that
sample to the population.

219
00:13:00.493 --> 00:13:03.041
However we're going to be wide
eyed about those assumptions and

220
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:04.710
we're going to formally develop them.

221
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.750
So at any rate, in this class, to every
estimator there will be an estimand.

222
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.110
The sample mean will estimate
the population mean.

223
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.410
The sample median will estimate
the population median.

224
00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.310
The sample standard deviation will

225
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.470
estimate the population
standard deviation.

226
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.440
And so on.

227
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.930
This is the formal process
of statistical inference,

228
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.590
linking your sample to a population.
