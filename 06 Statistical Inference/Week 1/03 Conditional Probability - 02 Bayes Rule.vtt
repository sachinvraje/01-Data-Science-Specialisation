00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.718
Perhaps one of the most famous
uses of conditional probability is

2
00:00:04.718 --> 00:00:06.508
so-called Bayes' rule.

3
00:00:06.508 --> 00:00:10.890
This rule is named after a Presbyterian
minister named Thomas Bayes who had his

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.585
work published posthumously.

5
00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:17.450
Bayes' rule allows us to reverse
the role of the conditioning set and

6
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.610
the set that we want the probability of.

7
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.180
So imagine in the event that we
want the probability of b given a.

8
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.851
When we have, or can easily calculate
the probability of a given b.

9
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:30.510
Well Bayes' rule says you can do that.

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.410
You can evaluate b given a to a given b.

11
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.930
But you need some other information.

12
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.910
You need the probability
of b marginalized over a.

13
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.850
And this is quite useful in
the sense of diagnostic test.

14
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.050
And we'll go over some
examples here in a minute.

15
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.400
So, let's talk about conditional
probability in the context of

16
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.640
diagnostic test.

17
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.030
One of the most important examples of
conditional probability and Bayes' Rule.

18
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.870
Let's let plus and

19
00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.280
minus be the events of the, be the event
that the test is positive or negative.

20
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.360
Let's think of a test for a disease.

21
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.510
So plus being that the test says
the person has the disease, and

22
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.580
minus being that, saying that they don't.

23
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.820
And then let's D and D complement be
the event that the person either does or

24
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.130
does not have the dis,
disease, respectively.

25
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.490
Then the sensitivity is the probability
that the test is positive given that

26
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.830
the subject actually has the disease.

27
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.670
This would be a marker of a good test.

28
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.250
You would want the sensitive,
sensitivity to be high.

29
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.700
The specificity is
the probability that the test is

30
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.240
negative given that the subject
does not have the disease.

31
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.670
Probability minus given D complement.

32
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.950
Again, you want the specificity
to be high for a test to be good.

33
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.100
And notice in the development
of diagnostic test,

34
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.530
these things are at least
conceptually obtainable.

35
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.760
There is, of course, a lot of difficulties
in finding good sensitivity and

36
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.260
specificity estimates.

37
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.580
But for example, in an HIV blood test,
you could take people who you

38
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.430
know to have the disease and
apply the diagnostic test to that blood.

39
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.490
You could also take people who you knew
for sure did not have the disease.

40
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.480
And you could apply the diagnostic
test to the blood sample,

41
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.100
blood samples from those subjects.

42
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.600
If you happen to have a positive test,
the number that is most of

43
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.340
concern to you is the probability of
having disease given that positive test,

44
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.606
the so-called positive predictor value.

45
00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:22.180
If you have a negative test,
your interested in the probability of not

46
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.670
having the disease,
given that negative test.

47
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.220
The so called negative predictive value.

48
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.481
We might say in the absence of a test,
we might say the probability of

49
00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:34.900
having the disease is the so
called prevalence of the disease.

50
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.670
Let's go through an example.

51
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.250
A study comparing the efficacy of HIV test
reports on an experiment which concluded

52
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.563
that the antibody tests have a sensitivity
of 99.7 and a specificity of 98.5.

53
00:02:49.563 --> 00:02:51.130
So these are kind of made up numbers.

54
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.600
So don't think of these as cardinal
truths about antibody test for HIV.

55
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.390
Suppose that a subject from a population
with a 0.1% prevalence of HIV

56
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.020
receives a positive test result.

57
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.320
What is the associated
positive predictive value?

58
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.720
So mathematically, we want the probability
of disease, given a positive test result,

59
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.850
given the sensitivity and the specificity
and the prevalence, P of D, 0.001.

60
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.290
So let's plug directly into Bayes' rule.

61
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.120
We want probability of disease
given a positive test result.

62
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.810
That's the probability of the positive
test result, given disease,

63
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.370
times the probability of disease,
divided by this denominator right here.

64
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.162
And again, it's not immediately
clear where the numbers from

65
00:03:41.162 --> 00:03:43.502
the problem are coming from here.

66
00:03:43.502 --> 00:03:47.562
But let's just note that the probability
of a positive test result,

67
00:03:47.562 --> 00:03:52.182
given that the person does not have
the disease, is 1 minus the probability of

68
00:03:52.182 --> 00:03:56.382
a negative test result given that
the person does not have the disease or

69
00:03:56.382 --> 00:03:58.900
that's 1 minus the specificity.

70
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.810
And the probability of disease complement
is 1 minus the probability of disease.

71
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.150
Now we've rewritten it only in
terms of things that we know.

72
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.460
And we can just plug in the numbers and
get 6% as our probability.

73
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.240
So in this population,
a positive test result only res,

74
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.320
suggests a 6% probability that
the subject has the disease.

75
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.629
So in other words, the positive
predictive value is 6% for this test.

76
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.980
The low positive predictor value
in this case is largely due to

77
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.630
the low prevalence of the disease.

78
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.870
However, imagine in the process of
counselling this person about their

79
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.970
positive test result,

80
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.680
the counselor learned that
the subject was an intravenous drug

81
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.450
user that routinely had intercourse
with an HIV infected partner.

82
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.610
They would assume that the,
the relevant prevalence for

83
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.550
this person was much higher, and thus the
positive predictor value is much higher.

84
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.330
I want to now distinguish
between the component that is

85
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.270
dependent on this prevalence and
the component that is what I

86
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.970
would describe as the objective evidence
of the positive test result, and

87
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.260
that's what the diagnostic likely ratios
are, and that's what we'll cover next.

88
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.510
Here I just give the formula for

89
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.390
the positive predictive value again
as it's plugged into Bayes' rule.

90
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.480
And remember, this formula then
only depends on the sensitivity,

91
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.910
1 minus the specificity in
the prevalence of disease.

92
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.015
We can do the exact same thing for
1 minus this probability.

93
00:05:26.015 --> 00:05:29.840
One minus the positive predicted value,
which is the probability of not having

94
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.920
the disease given a positive test result,
and you get this formula to the right.

95
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.940
Notice that the denominator is identical
in either of the two probabilities.

96
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.410
And the numerator changes.

97
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.170
So if we were to divide these two
equations, we get the following.

98
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.710
The probability of disease given
a positive test result divided by

99
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.770
the probability of not having the disease
given a positive test result.

100
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.310
Whenever you take a probability and

101
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.500
divide it by 1 minus that probability,
you get the so called odds.

102
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.800
So here on the leftmost side,

103
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.900
we have the odds of disease given
a positive test result, and

104
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.940
on the rightmost side, we have the odds of
disease in the absence of the test result.

105
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.360
Here this factor in the middle is
the diagnostic likelihood ratio of

106
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.820
a positive test result.

107
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.400
So the equation is,
the pretest odds of disease

108
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.980
times the diagnostic likelihood ratio,
equals the post-test odds of disease.

109
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.630
So in other words, the diagnostic
likelihood ratio of a positive test

110
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.750
result is the factor by which you
multiply your odds in the presence of

111
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.990
a positive test to obtain
your post-test odds.

112
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.960
So let's go through our example.

113
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.220
Suppose that subject has
a positive HIV test.

114
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.290
If we calculate using our sensitivity and

115
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.950
specificity from before, the diagnostic
likelihood ratio works out to be 0.997,

116
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.070
divided by 1 minus 0.985,
which works out to be 66.

117
00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.690
In other words,
no matter what your pre-test odds are,

118
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.040
you multiply them times 66 to
obtain your post-test odds.

119
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.320
Or in other words,
the hypothesis of disease is 66

120
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.560
times more supported by the data
than the hypothesis of no disease.

121
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.180
Now, if the pretest odds are very small,
then still multiplying by

122
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.970
66 will result in a still small number,
though 66 times larger.

123
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.850
Let's just very quickly go over
an incidence when a subject has

124
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.380
a negative test result
in using the DLR minus.

125
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.640
So, in this case,
the DLR minus from the sensitivity and

126
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.503
specificity given before is 0.003.

127
00:07:33.503 --> 00:07:37.900
So, therefore, your post-test
odds of disease in the light of

128
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:43.350
a negative test result is now 0.3% that
of the pre-test odds of the te, disease.

129
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.050
Or in other words, the hypothesis of
disease is supported 0.003 times that of

130
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.030
the hypothesis of the absence of
disease given the negative test result.
