00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.620
Hi, my name is Brian Caffo and

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.650
welcome to this Statistical Inference
Coursera Data Science class.

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.670
In this class,

4
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.030
we are gonna learn about the process
of formal statistical inference.

5
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.620
So I define statistical
inference as the process of

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.340
generating conclusions about
a population from a noisy sample.

7
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.690
Without statistical influence,
we're simply living within our data.

8
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.000
With statistical inference,
we're trying to generate new knowledge.

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.640
We're trying to extend beyond our
data to a population to give answers.

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.228
With statistical inference,

11
00:00:36.228 --> 00:00:39.470
our estimators have actual
things that they're estimating.

12
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.959
And in fact, I would say statistical
inference is the only formal system of

13
00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:47.610
inference that we have.

14
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.730
Let me give you some examples.

15
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.519
Hopefully you'll understand
what I'm talking about.

16
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.880
Consider trying to predict who's going
to win an election on election day,

17
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.040
given a sample of likely voters today.

18
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.240
Well, there our sample is a noisy dataset.

19
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.190
Some people might not actually
vote on election day.

20
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.785
Some people might change their mind
as to what they're going to say now.

21
00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:13.440
Or some people be deliberately misleading.

22
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.470
So we'd like to try to draw
together all that uncertainty and

23
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.270
use that to predict who's
gonna win on election day.

24
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.530
When a weather man tells you the
probability that it rains tomorrow is 70%,

25
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.520
they're trying to use the historical data
that is particularly the most recent data,

26
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.860
to predict tomorrow's weather and
actually attach a probability to it.

27
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.060
That probability refers to a population.

28
00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:46.720
An example that's very close to
the research I do is trying to predict

29
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.890
what areas of the brain activate
when we put them in an fMRI scanner.

30
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.260
In that case, people are doing a task
while they're in the scanner, for example,

31
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.540
tapping their finger or
something like that.

32
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.510
And we like'd to compare when they're
tapping their finger, to when they're not.

33
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.760
And try to figure out what areas of the
brain are associated with finger tapping.

34
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.990
That's just one example there.

35
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.200
Again, these are all very different
aspects of statistical inference.

36
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.530
They're very different in the ways
in which we're thinking about and

37
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.380
modeling the randomness.

38
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.490
And so I think you'll probably get
the sense that statistical inference is

39
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.520
a kind of challenging
subject because of that.

40
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.550
One thing I want to mention briefly and
hopefully get out of the way as early as

41
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.190
possible is the idea that there's many
different modes of statistical inference.

42
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.190
And, in fact,
there's a recent New York Times article

43
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.670
that described the difference between
so-called Bayesians and frequentists,

44
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.830
two different kinds of
inferential paradigms.

45
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.600
And I think when you first come into this
discipline, you might even be surprised

46
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.830
that there can even be more than
one way to think about statistics.

47
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.040
But, in fact, even amongst so
called Bayesians and

48
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.360
even amongst so-called frequentists,

49
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.452
there's all different variations and
shades of grays, and there's many

50
00:02:58.452 --> 00:03:02.040
a Bayesians that I would say just really
behaved like frequentists and so on.

51
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.675
So, what we're gonna do in this class to
make it as straightforward as possible is

52
00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:14.575
to pick a very particular paradigm,
this frequentist paradigm,

53
00:03:14.575 --> 00:03:18.780
that's the one that's most commonly taught
in introductory statistics classics.

54
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.240
The reason I elected to do
this is because it's the most

55
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.140
likely one that you'll
encounter in practice.

56
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.720
And also, I think once you've develop some
of these fundamentals, you'll be able to

57
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.910
extend this knowledge to lots of different
areas and you'll be able to build on it.

58
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.050
So we wanna build a good foundation.

59
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.970
We're going to do it with sort
of frequency style thinking.

60
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.850
What I mean by frequency
style thinking is,

61
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.260
we're gonna think of probability
like how we think of gambling.

62
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.590
So I'm gonna think the probability that
a coin winds up as heads is gonna be,

63
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.310
if I were to flip it maybe infinitely many
times, and there's all this randomness

64
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.520
that I'm thinking about in the coin flip,
and the proportion of heads would really

65
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.800
define a sort of intrinsic
probability of the head to the coin.

66
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.337
That's a frequentist style of thinking.

67
00:04:02.337 --> 00:04:06.670
It's sort of the idea that we can repeat
an experiment over and over and over again

68
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.462
and the percentage of times that something
happens defines that population parameter.

69
00:04:13.517 --> 00:04:17.032
There is more than one way to
think about probability, and

70
00:04:17.032 --> 00:04:19.700
more than one way to
think about inference.

71
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.070
But we're gonna focus on specifically
frequency styling inference like that.

72
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.930
Like the coin flipping and
all the gambling experiments that we're

73
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.760
very familiar with and we're gonna
leave all that other stuff to the side.

74
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.640
In the notes, I give you some examples of
all different sorts of topics that you

75
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.960
can try to build on after you've mastered
some of the tools from this class.

76
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.790
Let me give you just a quick example.

77
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.130
There's a thriving community now
that's trying to figure out how can

78
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.390
we really infer causation,
not just association, but

79
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.900
real causation using noisy statistical
data, and that's a very deep problem.

80
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.740
And what they'd like to do is enumerate
the assumptions and a set of tools and

81
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.800
statistical study designs
that will lead us to

82
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.020
develop causality rather than association.

83
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.650
That requires us to do things like
define what we mean by something causing

84
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.440
something else.

85
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.720
It's a very deep field and at any rate,

86
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.560
that's one example of the couple I give
in the notes where you can build on this.

87
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.160
For example, survey sampling,
epidemiological studies and so on.

88
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.230
But again, what I'd like to do in a very
short class like this is really focus on

89
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:31.110
building our foundation in basic frequency
style probability models and testing.

90
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.240
So I'd like to welcome you to the class.

91
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.540
The way that you want to
think about this class is,

92
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.090
if you're sort of keeping pace with it,
it's a four-week class.

93
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.510
But if you're struggling
with some of the concepts,

94
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.150
don't feel badly about having to
extend this class out, take it twice.

95
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.200
This is deep stuff and it's unusual
I think, and it's not the math and

96
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.910
it's not the,
I know many mathematicians who

97
00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.660
really struggle when they first start
thinking about statistical inference cuz

98
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.360
it's just a different way of
thinking about the world.

99
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.550
So think of this as a four-week class.

100
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.890
And if you're getting it, if you're not,
take a little bit more time.

101
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.840
There's four quizzes.

102
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.410
There's one project.

103
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.850
The project, I really think drives home
some of the central ideas of inference.

104
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.990
So I hope that you would spend a fair
amount of time thinking about the project

105
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.180
because it really drives home what we
mean by sampling distributions and

106
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.350
what is meant by frequency
style statistical inference.

107
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.960
The quizzes will be auto-graded.

108
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.400
They're, ideally,
due at the end of each week but

109
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.420
you can attempt all the quizzes
from the start of the class.

110
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.110
I've put out some homework problems and
I've linked those homework problems to

111
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.730
the specific quiz questions so you can
practice before you even try the quiz.

112
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.670
So welcome to the class.

113
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.250
I'm really enthusiastic
about teaching you.

114
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.930
I really like inference.

115
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.530
It's my favorite subject.

116
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.580
I've been studying statistical
inference for probably 15 years now.

117
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.490
And every time I think about it,
I learn something new.

118
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.840
And so I hope you can really
dive into this deep and

119
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.560
incredibly important subject with me.
