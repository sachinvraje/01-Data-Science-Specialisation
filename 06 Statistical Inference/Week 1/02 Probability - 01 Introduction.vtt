00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.040
Hi, and
welcome to the class on Probability,

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.400
as part of the Statistical Inference class
in the Coursera Data Science series.

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.290
My name is Brian Caffo, and

4
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.800
this class is co-taught with my
co-instructors, Jeff Leek and Roger Peng.

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.300
We're all in the Department of
Biostatistics at the Bloomberg School of

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:15.870
Public Health.

7
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.250
In this lecture, I'm going to cover
probability at a very basic level,

8
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.929
just enough for what we need in
the data science specialization.

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.780
I have a more in-depth treatment in
my mathematical biostatistics boot

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.650
camp series.

11
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.500
You can watch them on a YouTube playlist
anytime you'd like, and then the course is

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.710
offered about every two months on
Coursera, and I give the link here.

13
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.640
In addition,
the course notes are on GitHub.

14
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.120
Let's talk about probability.

15
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.450
So, given a random experiment,
say for example, rolling a die,

16
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.810
a probability measures the population
quantity that summarizes the randomness.

17
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.530
I want to emphasize this
word population here.

18
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.370
What this means in the die roll context,

19
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.880
is that we think of it as
an intrinsic property of the die,

20
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.540
not of something that is a function of
a simple set of fixed rolls of the die.

21
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.930
So, when we talk about probability,

22
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.760
we're not talking about something
that is in the data that we have, but

23
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.600
as a conceptual thing that exists in the
population that we would like to estimate.

24
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.448
So, let's be specific about the rules
that probability has to follow,

25
00:01:20.448 --> 00:01:22.860
so-called probability calculus.

26
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.529
First of all, probability operates on
the potential outcomes from an experiment.

27
00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:29.641
For example, when you roll a die,
you could get a 1, or

28
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:34.209
you could say, the roll was in the set 1
or 2, or the roll was an even number, 2,

29
00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:37.813
4, 6, or the roll was an odd number,
1, 3, 5, and so on.

30
00:01:37.813 --> 00:01:40.818
So, the probability is a function
that takes any of these sets of

31
00:01:40.818 --> 00:01:43.669
possible outcomes and
assigns it a number between 0 and 1.

32
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.810
You have to have the rule that
the probability that something occurs,

33
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.270
in other words, that you roll the die,
and you get a number, must be one.

34
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.600
And, then the probability of the union
of any two sets of outcomes that

35
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.690
have nothing in common must be the sum
of their respective probabilities.

36
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.950
So, for example, take for

37
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.810
example, when I roll the die, one possible
outcome is that I get a one or a two.

38
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.770
Another possible outcome is
that I get a three or a four.

39
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.070
Those two sets, one and

40
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.100
two, and the other set, three and
four, are mutually exclusive.

41
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.880
They can not both simultaneously occur.

42
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.010
The probability of the union,
that I get a 1, a 2, a 3, or a 4,

43
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.450
is the sum of the two probabilities, the
sum of the probability that I get a 1 or

44
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.590
a 2, plus the sum of the probability
that I get a 3 or a 4.

45
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.380
It turns out that these simple rules are
all that are necessary to generalize to

46
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.360
all the rules that we think
that probability should follow.

47
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.105
And, this was discovered by
the Russian mathematician Kolmogorov.

48
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.460
Here are some of the rules
that probability must follow.

49
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.230
Some of them I stated already, and

50
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.600
some of them are consequences
of what I stated already.

51
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.700
The first is the probability
that nothing occurs as zero, so

52
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.840
you have to roll the die.

53
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.590
Something has to occur,
you have to get a number.

54
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.640
And, that's similarly related to
the probability that something occurs,

55
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.310
that you do get a number is a one.

56
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.020
Something that we intuitively seem to th,
to know,

57
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.850
is the probability of something is 1 minus
the probability that the opposite occurs.

58
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.430
So, the probability of getting an even
number when I roll the die is 1 minus

59
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.210
the probability of getting an odd number.

60
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.340
Because, the odd numbers are the opposite
of getting an even number in

61
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.600
the context of a die.

62
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.990
The probability of at least one of two or
more things that cannot simultaneously

63
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.300
occur, we call sets of things that cannot
simultaneously occur mutually exclusive,

64
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.600
is the sum of their
respective probabilities.

65
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.740
This was part of the basic definition
that we outlined in the previous slide.

66
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.395
Another consequence of
our probability calculus,

67
00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:42.210
if the event A implies
the occurrence of the event B,

68
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.110
then the probability of A occurring is
less than the probability that B occurs.

69
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.460
And, this is kind of
a tongue twister to say, and

70
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.540
it seems a little bit conceptually hard.

71
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.870
However, if we draw a Venn diagram,
it becomes very simple.

72
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.340
The event A lives inside of the event B.

73
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.710
So, when we talk about
the probability of A,

74
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.240
we talk about a number
assigned to this circle A.

75
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.120
When we talk about B,
we talk about the probability assigned to

76
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.850
this circle that includes the area of A,
so

77
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.170
it would make sense that the probability
of B was larger than the probability of A.

78
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.290
So, I think we intuit this very easily.

79
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.130
For example, the probability
that we get a 1, the set A,

80
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.780
is less than the probability that
we get a 1 or a 2, the set B.

81
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.700
Then this final bullet
point is very useful.

82
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.060
For any two events, the probability
that at least one occurs is the sum of

83
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.820
their probabilities minus
their intersection.

84
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.390
Again, this becomes very easy to
visualize with a Venn diagram.

85
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.500
Here we have the set A,
and we have the set B.

86
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.260
If we add their two probabilities,

87
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.730
you see that we've added
the intersection in twice.

88
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.520
Once when we added in A, and
once when we added in B.

89
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.970
Since we've added it in twice,

90
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.580
if we want the probability of the union,
we need to subtract it out once.

91
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.500
The result of this rule is to say that
you can't just add probabilities if

92
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.430
they have a non trivial interact,
in intersection.

93
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.940
And, we'll give an example
of that in a second.

94
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.620
The National Sleep Foundation reports that
around 3% of the American population has

95
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.560
sleep afne, apnea.

96
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.760
They also report around 10%
of the North American and

97
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.540
European population has
restless leg syndrome.

98
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.100
Let's assume, for

99
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.490
the sake of argument, that these are
probabilities from the same population.

100
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.330
Can we just simply add these
probabilities, and conclude that about 13%

101
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.640
of people have at least one sleep problem
of these sorts in this population?

102
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.700
So, the answer is no,
the events can simultaneously occur, and

103
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.640
so are not mutually exclusive.

104
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.390
We think that there is a non-trivial
component of the population that

105
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.870
has both sleep apnea and
restless leg syndrome.

106
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.410
So, to elaborate, let's let A be the event
that a person drawn from this population

107
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.690
has sleep apnea, and B be the event
that they have restless leg syndrome.

108
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.150
Here, we think this intersection is
non-trivial, and so if we were to

109
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.490
add the two probabilities, we would
believe we will have added it in twice and

110
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.020
it would need to get subtracted out
to find the probability of the union.
