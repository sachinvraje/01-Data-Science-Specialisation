00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.630
Now, lets talk about an example of
obtaining a population expected value.

2
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.540
So suppose a coin is flipped and

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.740
X is declared 0 or
1 corresponding to a head or a tail.

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.100
What is the expected value of X?

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.780
So again, the expected value is
the property of the population.

6
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.240
If we plug into our formula expected
value of X, is the probability 0.5 times

7
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.580
the value 0 plus the probability 0.5 times
value 1, so all the values that the coin

8
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.780
can take 0, 1 times the probability
that it can take them, added up.

9
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.950
This winds up to be 0.5.

10
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.430
So notice the expected value is
a value that the coin can't even take.

11
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.010
However, if we were to think
about this geometrically,

12
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.690
the answer is quite obvious.

13
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.000
If we have two bars, they are equal
height, one at 0 and one at 1.

14
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.980
And we wanted to balance them out.

15
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.310
It's clear where exactly we'd
put our finger if we wanted to.

16
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.721
It would be right here at 0.5.

17
00:00:59.762 --> 00:01:03.776
Suppose that a random variable X is such
that P, the probability that it takes

18
00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:08.200
the value 1 as p, and the probability
it takes the value 0 is 1 minus p.

19
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.190
This is a biased coin,

20
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.810
where the probability of
the head is not necessarily 0.5.

21
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.540
The probability of the head is now p.

22
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.590
What is it's expected value?

23
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.385
We'll plug in directly and

24
00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:22.950
then formula 0 times 1 minus p plus
1 times p which works out to be p.

25
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.660
So the expected value of a coin flip,

26
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.780
even a potentially biased coin
is exactly the true long run

27
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.650
proportions of heads you would obtain
in infinitely many flips of the coin.

28
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.520
What about a die?

29
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.640
Suppose that a die is rolled, and

30
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.084
X is the number that is face up,
what is the expected value of X?

31
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.196
So, here we take the values 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and

32
00:01:49.196 --> 00:01:53.762
multiply them the, times the probability
that the random variable takes them.

33
00:01:53.762 --> 00:01:55.930
One-sixth, one-sixth, and so on.

34
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.430
You get 3.5.

35
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.700
Again, a number that the die
can't actually obtain.

36
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.070
So again,
the geometric argument makes this obvious.

37
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.670
We have six bars, all of height one-sixth,
and if we had to balance them out,

38
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.909
it's clear that we would
balance them out at 3.5.
