00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:07.860
So, let's consider the data, the library
using r, and then the father.son data.

2
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.530
And I'm, just to make my life a little
bit easier, I'm going to define x here,

3
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.110
as the son's heights, just so I don't
have to keep referring to the data frame.

4
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.849
Let's let n be the number of observations.

5
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.880
And then I'm going to do
10,000 boot strap resamples.

6
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.100
So what I'm going to do now,
is the sample command.

7
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.460
So when I say sample x,
that means draw from x,

8
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.980
n times b numbers of resamples.

9
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.840
Where in every case when I,
because I put replace equals true,

10
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.330
every time I take an observation,
I take a son's height out of the bag.

11
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.490
I put it back in okay.

12
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.330
So what is this?

13
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.830
This is simulating from an empirical
distribution defined by our data

14
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.310
that puts probability 1 over n
on each observed data point.

15
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.880
This is called the empirical.

16
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.530
Distribution.

17
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.090
And then I'm going to arrange these in
a matrix with number of bootstrap rows and

18
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.040
number of sample sizes columns.

19
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.640
And so what that means is, every row of
this matrix that I'm calling resamples

20
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.310
is now a completely resampled data
set where I took my original data.

21
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.160
And I drew a sample of size n with
replacement from that dataset.

22
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.040
And that's exactly equivalent to
regenerating a sample of size n from

23
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.440
a distribution that places probability
of 1 over n on each observed data point.

24
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.609
And then let's suppose the statistic
I'm interested in is the median.

25
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.850
And so I'm going to take for
each of these data sets,

26
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.830
each of these resampled data sets,
and I'm going to apply the median, and

27
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.900
that's what this final
apply statement does.

28
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.870
So here's a density estimate
from the resample of medians.

29
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.749
I've drawn a vertical line for
our observed median.

30
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.800
So what we've done in this case

31
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.850
is we've taken our vector of sun's
heights and we've repeatedly drawn

32
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.710
from those collection of sun's heights
a new data set of the same length.

33
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.530
Where we drew with replacement with equal
probability on every observed data point.

34
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.900
Then for each one of these new data
sets we calculated the median,

35
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.940
we did that 10,000 times, and
we got a collection of medians.

36
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.670
What this density estimate is,
is an estimate

37
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.240
of the distribution of
medians where we don't

38
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.435
know the actual population distribution
we're estimating from our observed.

39
00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:48.492
Data.

40
00:02:48.492 --> 00:02:54.440
This is the central quantity
used in bootstrapping.

41
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.940
For example, in the case, we're
bootstrapping the median, and we might

42
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.620
want to do something like take the
standard deviation of this distribution,

43
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.500
and that is going to be an estimate of
the standard error of the median, right?

44
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.320
The standard deviation of the sampling
distribution of the median.

45
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.510
We could do for example, quantiles to
get confidence interval estimates, and

46
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.110
these are the sorts of things that you do
with your bootstrap resample distribution.

47
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.680
So let's go through a couple
of the principles and

48
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.420
just rediscuss broot,
bootstrapping generally, and

49
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.530
then we'll work through this
example a little bit more.
