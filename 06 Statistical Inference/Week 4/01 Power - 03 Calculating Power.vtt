1
00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:06.860
Let's assume that our sample is
exactly normally distributed.

2
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.170
Whether this is because we're willing to
stomach that assumption because we have

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.840
a large sample size and we're
applying the central limit theorem or

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.220
if we're willing to just assume that
the underline population is exactly

5
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.470
normally distributed.

6
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.900
Either way, for the sake of argument let's
assume that X bar is normally distributed,

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.800
and that sigma, the standard
deviation of the population is known.

8
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.220
Then we would reject if our z statistic,

9
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.400
x bar minus 30 over it's standard
error is bigger than z1 minus alpha.

10
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.070
This is the same as just saying we're
going to reject if x bar is bigger than 30

11
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.660
plus this z quantile times
the standard err of the mean.

12
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.920
Now notice under the null hypothesis
X bar follows this distribution.

13
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.060
Normal with a mean equal to mu naught.

14
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.330
In this case 30.

15
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.970
And the variance equal
to sigma squared over N.

16
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.260
Under the alternative it
follows the same distribution.

17
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.690
The only difference is instead
of mu naught we have mu a.

18
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.970
Where mu a is the value
under the alternative.

19
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.700
So it's very easy to write out in r,
what our power would be.

20
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.710
We want to take pnorm of
the probab in other words,

21
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.470
the normal probability of
getting a sample mean.

22
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.930
Mu naught plus z times
sigma over square root n or

23
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.920
larger, where this probability simply
calculated with mu equal to mu a.

24
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.840
So here we have mean mu, mean equal
to mu a, our standard deviation is

25
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.490
the standard error of the mean, and
I've put lower.tail equals false.

26
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.120
So that I get the upper probability.

27
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.580
Now notice if I were to plug in mu equal
to mu naught then I should get alpha, and

28
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.020
now as I plug as mu
a moves away from alpha

29
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.370
the power should get larger and larger.

30
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.100
So let's try it.

31
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.440
Suppose someone were to give me this
information that they wanted to conduct

32
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.890
this study, they wanted to test whether or
not mu was 30 for

33
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.300
this population or it was larger than 30.

34
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.110
So mu naught equals 30.

35
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.260
They were interested
a difference as large as 32,

36
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.890
their end was 16,

37
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.530
that they were hoping to get, and
they knew that sigma was around 4.

38
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.030
Okay?

39
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.850
So here I've plugged in the values
mu naught equal 30, mu a equals 32,

40
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.100
sigma equals 4, n equals 16, here's my
z is my normal quintile, and then first

41
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.940
I want to show you if I plug in mu equal
to mu naught that it should give me 5%.

42
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.760
So here I plug in mu equal
to mu naught and I get 5%.

43
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.400
Now I'm plugging in mu equal to mu a 32,
and you see that this jumps up to 64%.

44
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.951
So, there's a 64% probability of
detecting a mean as large as 32 or

45
00:02:50.951 --> 00:02:53.955
larger if we conduct this experiment.

46
00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:02.933
So here I'm plotting the power curves,

47
00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:07.421
which is the power as a function of Mu a,

48
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:11.770
as n varies by color here, and.

49
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.850
As we head to the right on this plot,
so as we head along this axis,

50
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.500
that's mua getting bigger,
and this axis is power.

51
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.080
Okay?

52
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.080
So let's take a specific one
of these lines and look at it.

53
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.010
So this line, right here,
is the power when n equals a.

54
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.860
And what you can see is all of the lines,
is including the one that we're discussing

55
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.510
right now,
converge at 0.05 as mu approaches 30.

56
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.149
And then what you can see is that
power increases as mu a gets larger.

57
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.420
Okay?
And basically that means we're more likely

58
00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.560
to detect a difference if the difference
we want to detect is very big.

59
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.260
And that makes a lot of sense.

60
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.365
If something's a huge effect,
we should be very probably,

61
00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:12.105
it should be very probably to detect it.

62
00:04:12.105 --> 00:04:16.345
And then the other thing I would
note is that as we head up here,

63
00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:21.974
we're seeing sample sizes doubled with
each line, I start out with N equal to 8,

64
00:04:21.974 --> 00:04:27.718
then I move to N equal to 16 right there
and then 32 and then 64 and then 128.

65
00:04:27.718 --> 00:04:31.190
And what you can see is the curves
all getting shoved up to higher and

66
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.410
higher power earlier and earlier.

67
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.040
And this makes a lot of sense as well.

68
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.180
In other words, as we collect a lot
more data, we should be more likely

69
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.030
to detect a power of a var, of a specific,
for a specific value of mu a.

70
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:55.430
And so that's why, the mu n equal
to 128 curve is uniformly above.

71
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.240
The N equal to 64 curve, and so on.

72
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.660
Let's use our studio's manipulate function

73
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.410
to evaluate power as it relates
to the two normal densities.

74
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.110
So here I'm going to
do library manipulate,

75
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.359
then I'm going to define mu0 to be 30.

76
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.140
Then I'm going to define a plotting
function that depends on the population,

77
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.360
standard deviation, the mean under
the alternative, the sample size,

78
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.250
and the type-1 error rate.

79
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.520
Then it does ggplot.

80
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.260
So, I'm,
then it's going to execute that plot.

81
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.520
But it's going to give me a slider so
that I can vary all of these parameters.

82
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.210
Let me first describe these two plots
before we start using manipulate function.

83
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.300
Currently the parameters are set at
the values we've used in the previous

84
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.068
calculations.

85
00:05:53.068 --> 00:05:54.680
Sigma was 4.

86
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.970
Mu a was 32, n was 16 and alpha was 5%.

87
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.530
So what this plot is saying is

88
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.460
under the null hypothesis here's
the distribution of our sample mean.

89
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.380
It's centered at 30 and
it has a variance of sigma squared over n.

90
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.630
Under the alternative.

91
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.860
It's centered at 32 and
it has a variance of sigma squared over n.

92
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:29.430
We've set a critical value, so
that if we get a sample mean that's

93
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.620
larger than a specific threshold
we reject the null hypothesis.

94
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.310
That's this line.

95
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.920
We set this line such that the
probability, if the red density is true,

96
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.790
the null hypothesis is true this area,

97
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.615
the probability of getting
statistics larger than it is 5%.

98
00:06:49.615 --> 00:06:53.800
Now power is

99
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.250
nothing other than the probability
of getting larger than this

100
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.767
line which is calibrated to have
this area under the red curve is 5%.

101
00:07:02.767 --> 00:07:07.010
The probability that we reject if
in fact the blue curve is true.

102
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.540
That's the power.

103
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.539
Here's 1 minus the power or
the type two error rate.

104
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.370
Okay.

105
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.050
Now let's start varianting and,
and see what happens.

106
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.840
So if we move it so that its all the way
down at 1% that's just saying that this

107
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.814
area right here under the red curve
needs to be 1, calibrated to be 1%.

108
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.610
At, as we move it down.

109
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.390
Let me just reiterate this point.

110
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.870
As we move it down its going to
move to the right like that.

111
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.140
But what's going to happen to power?

112
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.935
Power is going to go down.

113
00:07:39.935 --> 00:07:40.872
Right?

114
00:07:44.808 --> 00:07:51.050
This area is going down
as that thing moves.

115
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:56.910
And what's this,
what is this thing saying?

116
00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:01.900
By moving alpha down we're making it
harder to reject a null hypothesis.

117
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:07.890
We're making the requirement
of having a lot more evidence.

118
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.400
Before we conclude
the alternative is true.

119
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.500
That simply re, results in less power.

120
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.144
Now it's also it's got a lower
type I error rate, but

121
00:08:19.144 --> 00:08:21.641
a larger type II error rate,
and a lower power.

122
00:08:21.641 --> 00:08:23.486
Okay, conversely.

123
00:08:29.523 --> 00:08:33.045
If we increase alpha to
the highest level I set here,

124
00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:37.700
now we have a 10% type one error rate but
we have much better power.

125
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.220
In other words, if we are willing to
be a little bit looser in how much,

126
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.700
when we reject, if we, you know, get
smaller means and we're still rejecting.

127
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.140
Then we'll get better power.

128
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.520
Of course we do have
a larger type I error rate.

129
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.330
10%, in this case, instead of 5%.

130
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.440
So let's set it back to 5%.

131
00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.810
Let's see what happens
as we decrease sigma.

132
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.020
Sigma goes all the way down to 1.

133
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.430
Okay.
Now our black line moves.

134
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.440
Right.
Because I've, I've,

135
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.470
these are not standard normal curves.

136
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:13.570
These are, so our rejection region isn't
always so many standard errors from the,

137
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:18.220
from the mean in that,
instead we've decided to plot this on the,

138
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.000
on the scale of the problem.

139
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.060
So this black line then depends on sigma.

140
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:30.220
So as we move it, as we move sigma,
the black line moves with it.

141
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.612
Okay so let's move sigma down
to the lowest low, level I'm a,

142
00:09:33.612 --> 00:09:36.830
allowing which is sigma
equal to 1 in this case.

143
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.674
Okay so our black line has moved down and

144
00:09:40.674 --> 00:09:45.579
it's still calibrated so
that this area is 5%.

145
00:09:45.579 --> 00:09:47.376
But what we've seen is we have so

146
00:09:47.376 --> 00:09:51.573
little variability in the sample mean
that the probability of rejecting,

147
00:09:51.573 --> 00:09:56.235
the probability of getting larger than
the black line, if the blue distribution,

148
00:09:56.235 --> 00:09:59.655
alternative distribution,
is true, is almost 100%.

149
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:05.119
Okay, what happens if we move in the
opposite direction, we make SIGMA larger?

150
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.650
Well, here sigma very large.

151
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:16.080
Again we're still calibrated, so that this
area is 5%, but now power is much lower.

152
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.530
All this is saying, is that,
if we have a lot more

153
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:24.630
noise in our measurements,
then we're going to have lower power.

154
00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.720
Let's try some more.

155
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.560
Let's set this back to what it was at for
the problem 4.

156
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.900
How about the mean under the alternative.

157
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.000
Let's make it bigger.

158
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.130
What happens?

159
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.320
Well, it just moves along.

160
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.160
Right?

161
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.260
It just moves along to the right and
now we get a lot more power.

162
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.840
And the black line doesn't depend on
the mean under the alternative, so

163
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.720
it doesn't move, and then as it moves
towards 30, you can see the power's

164
00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:00.540
getting lower, and the lowest the power
can be is if it's, lies right on top of

165
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:06.570
the null distribution and then this,
the power'll be exactly point zero five.

166
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.330
Then it'll get a little bit bigger as it
moves further away and further away and

167
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.340
further away, until if we're at
35 we have almost 100% power.

168
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.810
Okay, let's set this back to 32, the value
that we're using for the problem.

169
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:20.560
How about n?

170
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.700
So, remember what happens as n increases.

171
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.070
Our sample mean gets less variable,

172
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.520
more observations go into our
sample mean it gets less variable.

173
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.708
So lets see what happens.

174
00:11:33.708 --> 00:11:34.825
Okay?

175
00:11:34.825 --> 00:11:39.730
Less variance, in our sample mean.

176
00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.229
So these densities are getting tighter and
tighter.

177
00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:43.810
Okay?

178
00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:45.870
But the black line moves,
because remember,

179
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.780
we it's always gotta be calibrated.

180
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:53.100
It's always gotta be calibrated so
that this area is 5%.

181
00:11:53.100 --> 00:12:00.130
But you can see now, we have a much better
power when we have a sample size of 50.

182
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.676
If we move it down to a sample size.

183
00:12:06.405 --> 00:12:11.374
Very low and a four,
again the black is moved,

184
00:12:11.374 --> 00:12:16.727
because it,
it has to force this area to be 5% and

185
00:12:16.727 --> 00:12:19.670
now our power is quite low.

186
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:27.310
So I would highly recommend that you
go through the code for this manipulate

187
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:32.060
experiment to understand how power works
in this particular setting, it's, it's,

188
00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:37.300
it's quite easy, but, basically, what you
can see is power has a bunch of knobs.

189
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.600
Oops.
And as you turn them,

190
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.140
the power changes in different ways,

191
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:44.730
and in the next slide, we'll summarize
the various aspects of power.

192
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.091
But using the manipulate
function like this,

193
00:12:47.091 --> 00:12:49.520
you can actually experiment
with it your self.
