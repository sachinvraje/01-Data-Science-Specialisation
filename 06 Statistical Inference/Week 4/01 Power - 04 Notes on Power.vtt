00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.030
So let's just reiterate when
we're testing our alternative

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.185
being that mu is greater than mu0.

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.800
And then I'm going to specify
power in terms of 1 minus beta,

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.110
where beta is the type two error rate.

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.270
Then we get this equation.

6
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.470
Our power is equal to
the probability that x

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.680
bar is larger than mu0 plus the standard
normal quintile times the standard error.

8
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.410
Where this probability's calculated under
the hypothesis that mu equals mu a.

9
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.890
And then I simply reiterate that
point here on the next line,

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.380
where I'm explicitly stating
that x bar is normal,

11
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.130
with mean mu a and
variance sigma squared over n.

12
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.416
So the point I'd like to make, is that
the unknowns in this equation are mu a,

13
00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:58.100
sigma, n, and beta, or
equivalently to beta the power you want.

14
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.030
The knowns are mu0 and
usually you know alpha,

15
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.150
you know exactly which type one
error way that you would like.

16
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.690
So, given these four unknowns and our
two knowns, this is simply an equation.

17
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.560
If you specify any three,
you can solve for the fourth.

18
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.900
So if you know the alternative
mean that you'd like to detect.

19
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.410
This a sigma that you're willing to
assume, the n that you want then you can

20
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.370
solve for power like we've done
previously, otherwise what you could do,

21
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.000
is you could say here's power that I want,
here's a m, mean that I'd like to detect.

22
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.270
And here's a sigma that I can tolerate,
and then I'd like to solve for the n

23
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.170
that would allow me to have that power,
maybe at the process of planning a trial.

24
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.920
And this is how power
calculations usually work.

25
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.280
You are particularly concerned most
of the time with either n or beta.

26
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.710
You usually either want to figure out for

27
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.990
a particular power that I want, what n
would I like to have, or should I have?

28
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.360
Or, I can only conduct
a study of this size,

29
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.290
of size n, what is my power for
doing that?

30
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.410
Should I even waste my time?

31
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.416
So, those are the two most common ways,
but of course,

32
00:02:21.416 --> 00:02:24.324
you could also solve for mu a, or sigma.

33
00:02:24.324 --> 00:02:29.004
So I'm hoping at this point in the class,
that you'll be able to take the work

34
00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:33.328
we've done for the greater than test,
and do it for the less than test.

35
00:02:33.328 --> 00:02:34.743
H0, mu, less than mu0,

36
00:02:34.743 --> 00:02:38.139
just by extending the arguments
from the previous set of slides.

37
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.550
When you're testing not equal to just make
sure you use the z1 minus alpha over 2,

38
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.730
instead of, z1 minus alpha,
that critical value.

39
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.924
So for example, for

40
00:02:48.924 --> 00:02:53.930
alpha equal to 0.05, you want to make
sure you use 1.96 and not 1.645.

41
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.890
And then just do the one sided power for
whatever direction mu a is,

42
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.620
whether it's mu a greater than mu0,
or Mu a less than Mu0.

43
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.260
And this isn't,
this is only approximately right,

44
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.880
it omits a small component of power,
but that, that

45
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.630
component of power is only meaningful,
if Mu a and Mu0 are close together.

46
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.730
So let's go through some
basic rules about power.

47
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.620
As Alpha gets larger,
our power gets larger.

48
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.450
So the power of a 1 sided test is greater
than the power of the associated 2

49
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.950
sided test, and we can see that by virtue
of just dividing alpha by 2 in this,

50
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.550
in this, bullet point above.

51
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:38.000
The further mu a gets, gets from mu0,
the higher the power is.

52
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.410
As n goes up the sample mean has less
variability, and so, we have higher power.

53
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.890
As sigma goes down our sample
mean has less variability, and so

54
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.540
we're going to have higher power.

55
00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.120
Now here's an interesting fact,
power usually doesn't depend

56
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.110
on all of these separate parameters, but
on some function of those parameters.

57
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.365
And in this particular case,
that function is one dimensional.

58
00:04:08.365 --> 00:04:13.200
So you really only need to know one number
to, to know to, to calculate power, and

59
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.286
it's basically the difference
between the null and

60
00:04:16.286 --> 00:04:19.320
alternative means divided
by the standard error.

61
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.840
And power only depends on those things,
or if you have power and

62
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.610
this number then you can calculate,
then you can calculate n.

63
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.454
So this quantity the difference and
the means divided by sigma,

64
00:04:34.454 --> 00:04:36.101
is called the effect size.

65
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:41.627
And, what's nice about the effect size is
that it's unit free, so when you subtract

66
00:04:41.627 --> 00:04:46.719
mu0 and minus mu a, mu, and divide it
by sigma, you get a unit free quantity.

67
00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:50.171
And that's why the effect size
is very useful because it,

68
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:55.111
you know, being unit free it has some hope
of being interpretable cross problems.
