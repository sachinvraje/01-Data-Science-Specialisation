00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.180
Hi, my name is Brian Caffo.

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.810
And this is the lecture on Power.

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.700
Power is the probability of
rejecting the null hypothesis,

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.910
when in fact the null hypothesis is false.

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.500
So, like its name would suggest,
power is a good thing you want more power.

6
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.110
And interestingly,
power comes more into play, when you

7
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.730
fail to reject an hypothesis than when
you reject, and let me try to explain.

8
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.390
So, imagine if you were to conduct
a study, that has low power.

9
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.650
For example, you want to compare
treatment A versus treatment B.

10
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.130
And you've only randomized three
people who received Treatment A, and

11
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.000
only three people who
received Treatment B.

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.450
Then when you make the comparison to see
if Treatment A results in a better outcome

13
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.260
than Treatment B, you would not be
surprised to get a null result,

14
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.600
because there were only
three people in each group.

15
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.830
You had very little power, to detect a
meaningful difference between the groups.

16
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.120
So, your null result was kind of expected.

17
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.370
Or kind of what you would think might
happen just due to chance alone.

18
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.640
On the other hand,
if you had 300 people in treatment A and

19
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.240
300 people in treatment A.

20
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.960
And you failed to reject, then that would
be meaningful, because you would expect to

21
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.796
see a difference,
since you collected so much data.

22
00:01:20.796 --> 00:01:25.890
And that' s why, power actually tends

23
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.000
to come more into play for null results,
than it does for non null results.

24
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.080
And the way the power
gets used most often,

25
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.970
as at the time of designing the study.

26
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.040
You want to design the study, so that you
have a reasonable chance of detecting

27
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.820
the alternative hypothesis,
if the alternative hypothesis is true.

28
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.580
So, let's also cover
a couple more details.

29
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.090
So a type II error is a bad, a bad thing,
as its name will suggest, an error.

30
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.360
Is failing to reject a null hypothesis,
when in fact a null hypothesis is false.

31
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.160
So, the probability of a type II
error is usually called beta, and

32
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.380
Power is just 1 minus beta.

33
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.350
So, the two most meaningful quantities for
hypothesis testing,

34
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.880
in terms of the two error rates for
hypothesis testing are alpha,

35
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.620
the type I error rate, and
beta the type II error rate.

36
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.430
But, we tend not to talk so
much beta instead,

37
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.720
we tend to talk about 1 minus beta,
this concept of power.

38
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.830
So let's go through

39
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.719
a conceptual example, and then we'll go
through some specific numerical examples.

40
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.800
So, remember we were interested in talking
about the hypothesis test for the mean

41
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.480
respiratory disturbance index, RDI, in
a particular population of obese subjects.

42
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.550
So, we wanted to test whether mu was 30,

43
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.420
versus the alternative that
mu was greater than 30.

44
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.840
We did a t statistic, which is,
in this case, our sample mean.

45
00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.600
Minus the hypothesised value 30 divided
by the standard error of the mean.

46
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.960
That statistic, we're assuming, follows a
t distribution under the null hypothesis.

47
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.310
So, if we calculate the probability that,
that statistic

48
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.140
is bigger than the upper one minus
alpha quantile of the t distribution.

49
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.560
That probability will be alpha,

50
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.950
if we calculate under the null
hypothesis when mu is 30.

51
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.180
So in this case then under, I would
write that mu a in this case equals 30.

52
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.780
Now power,
is simply the same calculation, but

53
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.510
instead of plugging in mu a equal to 30.

54
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.383
For the probability that we're
calculating, we plug in mu a for

55
00:03:42.383 --> 00:03:44.261
some value greater than 30.

56
00:03:48.098 --> 00:03:50.960
That winds up being our power.

57
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.320
Now imagine if I were to plug in a mu a of
say 60, then this would be a large number.

58
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.050
And that makes sense, right,
because if we want to detect whether or

59
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.000
not the mean for this population is 30 or
not, and it's really 60.

60
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.200
Then we should have a lot of power to
detect that, because when we collect

61
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.328
our data there'll be values around 60
instead of values around 30, okay?

62
00:04:18.328 --> 00:04:26.070
Now, imagine instead if our true
alternative mean was 30.00001.

63
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.534
Then we wouldn't have a lot
of power to detect that,

64
00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:30.670
because it's quite close
to the null value.

65
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.430
We're going to have lower power.

66
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.740
So, power, this power,

67
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.970
is a function that depends on
the mean under the null hypothesis.

68
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.430
If we plug in values close to 30,

69
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.550
it's going to look a lot
like our type I error rate.

70
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.710
And if we plug in values way away from 30,
it should get bigger and

71
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.824
bigger, to the point where it's nearly
100% if it's far enough away from 30.
