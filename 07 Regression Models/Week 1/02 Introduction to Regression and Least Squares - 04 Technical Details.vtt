00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.130
Now I'm going to go through the proof
that Y bar is the minimizer

2
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.710
for this equation here
as a function of mu.

3
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.220
If these kinds of proofs
aren't your thing,

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.460
then just skip it and in the subsequent
lectures the same thing though,

5
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.299
I'll give the same caveat before
each time I do something like this.

6
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.610
If you do intend to pay
attention to the proof,

7
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.160
you don't need to know either calculus or
linear algebra, but

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.380
ideally you'll be very comfortable
with mathematical notation.

9
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.780
So, for example, if you've had calculus in
your past, you've forgotten the specifics

10
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.080
of the calculus, but you're pretty
familiar with mathematical notation and

11
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.290
working with mathematical notation,
then that's all you need.

12
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.780
Okay, so let's go ahead and do it.

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.690
This is the quantity I'd like
to minimize as a function of mu.

14
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.910
My Y i's are my observed data points.

15
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.220
I'm going to subtract and then add Y bar.

16
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.890
So I've just added 0, changes nothing.

17
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.679
So I can have an equal sign there.

18
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.015
I can expand this square out and
I get this term,

19
00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:16.010
twice the cross-product term,
and then this term right here.

20
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.000
Let's look at this term right here.

21
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.058
Notice this doesn't depend on i, so I can
pull it outside of the sum, out here.

22
00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:33.570
Then notice this guy right here,
I can distribute the sum across it.

23
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.760
So I get summation Y i, and then if I
add up Y bar, which doesn't depend on i,

24
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.190
if I add it up n times i, I get n Y bar.

25
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:53.160
But notice, I would define Y bar as
1 over n times the summation Y i.

26
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.930
Add up my observations and
divide by n is the average.

27
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.926
So in other words,
n Y bar is equal to the summation of Y i.

28
00:02:01.926 --> 00:02:05.530
So this is 0.

29
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.350
That whole term then is 0.

30
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.440
Moving on to the next line,
I have summation Y i minus Y bar squared,

31
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.800
adding those up, and
summation Y bar minus mu squared.

32
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.310
This quantity is the sum of
a bunch of squared things.

33
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.810
Has to be positive.

34
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.250
So if I throw it out, my equal sign
gets turned into a greater than or

35
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.280
equal to sign.

36
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.141
I've only gotten smaller by throwing out a
bunch of positive things that I'm adding.

37
00:02:40.928 --> 00:02:42.923
Let's summarize.

38
00:02:42.923 --> 00:02:48.053
This function, for
any value of mu, is larger than or

39
00:02:48.053 --> 00:02:53.190
equal to the specific case
when we plug in Y bar.

40
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.320
Therefore, Y bar has to be the unique
minimizer of that equation.
