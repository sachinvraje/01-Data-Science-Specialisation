00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.890
Let's look at Francis Galton's data,
and, I just want to note he,

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.930
first used this data in 1885, and
that you should read up on Francis Galton.

3
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.750
He's really an interesting character,
in, in history, in general and,

4
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.970
and definitely in
the history of statistics.

5
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.480
Had many quirky aspects
to his personality and

6
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.290
he invented a lot of really great things
and some things that are not so great.

7
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.970
You need to run
install.packages("UsingR").

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.420
Here UsingR is the package for the book,
Using R for Introductory Statistics.

9
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.180
Is a great book, and

10
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.360
they've very kindly packaged all these
data sets together in a single R package.

11
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.420
So you need to use UsingR
then the library UsingR to,

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.110
to get a lot of the data sets that
we are going to be talking about.

13
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.370
So let's first look at the marginal
distribution of the parents.

14
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.900
In other words, distribution of
the parents disregarding children.

15
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.300
And the marginal distribution of
the children, disregarding parents.

16
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.580
Parent distribution is all heterosexual
couples, correcting for sex,

17
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.980
I guess,
by multiplying the female heights by 1.08.

18
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.310
Here I give my ggplot commands for
creating the two histograms.

19
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.140
On the left,
I have the children's heights.

20
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.010
The X-axis is in inches,
the scale goes from 60 inches to 75.

21
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.130
The Y-axis is the count, the number of
children that fall in each bin of heights.

22
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.300
On the right in the more bluish teal
color, I have the parents heights.

23
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.120
I've broken the association by
the children and the parents by not

24
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.490
doing a scatter plot, and only looking at
the marginal distribution of the children,

25
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.229
and the marginal distribution
of the parents by themselves.

26
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.730
I'd like to use these distributions
to introduce least squares,

27
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.020
and then we'll build on the bivaried
assoc, association after that.

28
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.270
So consider only the child's height,
for, forget for

29
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.360
the moment about using the parent's
height to predict the child's heights.

30
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.828
We just want to find maybe the best
prediction of the child's heights without

31
00:02:02.828 --> 00:02:05.700
any Information, any other information.

32
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.230
Well, probably the best predictor
would be the middle and

33
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.620
how could one define the middle?

34
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.240
Well, let's give one specific definition.

35
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.611
So I'm going to go through a little
bit of the notational mathematics and

36
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:20.327
if that isn't your thing, then wait just
a minute and we'll go through a sort

37
00:02:20.327 --> 00:02:23.719
of physical experiment,
experiment to sort of explain it visually.

38
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.678
So for the mathematics, let's let y i,
be the height for child i.

39
00:02:29.678 --> 00:02:32.755
Where y 1, is the height for child 1.

40
00:02:32.755 --> 00:02:36.110
Y 2, is the height for child 2, and so on.

41
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.940
My I index here goes from 1 to n, and

42
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.049
being 928 children in
this particular data set.

43
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.570
So the middle is the num will be
the value of mu that minimizes the sum of

44
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.510
the square distances between the observed
data, the y i's, and this value mu.

45
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.430
That's how we define the middle.

46
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.460
It's also related to physics in this so
called physical center of mass of the,

47
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.480
for example, of the histogram that
we showed on the previous slide.

48
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.600
If you thought of those bars as having,
being physical entities, having weight and

49
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.060
trying to figure out where you would
put your finger to balance it out.

50
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.710
That would be the physical center of mass.

51
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.310
You might have guessed that
the answer has to be the mean, right?

52
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.350
The center of the data has to be the mean.

53
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.130
And that does turn out to be the answer.

54
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.420
We'll even go through the proof.

55
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.140
Though, of course,

56
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.520
if that's not your thing then you
don't have to worry about the proof.

57
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.930
Let's use our studio's manipulate
function to experiment

58
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.990
with trying to find that center of mass.

59
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.170
So I've already loaded manipulate,
but maybe I can do it again.

60
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.270
I've loaded the data set Galton.

61
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.180
And I've defined a histogram function here

62
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.030
that executes the ggplot
commands to draw my histogram.

63
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:05.260
And it takes as an argument mu,
the parameter that we're trying to find.

64
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.214
So let me try my manipulate command here.

65
00:04:12.214 --> 00:04:15.720
Oh, I don't have ggplot2 loaded.

66
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:24.254
[SOUND] Let's try it again.

67
00:04:24.254 --> 00:04:26.460
There it is.

68
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.100
Okay, now, because we're using
manipulate I can move my slider around.

69
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.650
What I have up here is the value of mu and
the mean squared error,

70
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.840
that is the sum of the squared distances
between the observed data points and

71
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.560
that particular value of mu.

72
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.840
And because I've added up n things,

73
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.230
I might want the average
value instead of the sums.

74
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.220
So I divided by n,

75
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.940
and I get a mean squared error there
instead of the sum of the squared errors.

76
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.440
Okay.

77
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.170
So I can move it around, and notice as I
get toward the center of the histogram,

78
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.375
the mean squared error is going down.

79
00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:09.714
[SOUND] And around there might be as,

80
00:05:09.714 --> 00:05:15.003
the best I can do, 6.34.

81
00:05:15.003 --> 00:05:17.302
Now it's going back up.

82
00:05:17.302 --> 00:05:22.890
And then notice if I move it way up,
it get's up large again there it is at 14.

83
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.720
And so
what you can do is you can play around and

84
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.540
try to find the place
that actually minimizes

85
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.620
the sum of the squared distances between
the observed data points and mu.

86
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.999
This would be the point that
balanced out this histogram.

87
00:05:38.618 --> 00:05:42.380
Now we know with the answer, it has to
be exactly at the average of the child's

88
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.170
height, but you can actually experiment
and see that it minimizes that function.

89
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.610
Here I just give the code again, and
I want to remind everyone that the,

90
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.160
all the lecture notes are in these r mark
down format where you can get the code.

91
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.980
It's embedded in the actual
r mark down file.

92
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.250
So there should be
a file called index.rmd.

93
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.061
You can go into the index.rmd file and
get all the r code for

94
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:16.168
all of the lectures in
the entire specialization.

95
00:06:16.168 --> 00:06:20.510
Here I'm just reiterating that the least
squares estimate is the empirical mean.

96
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.538
And I'm showing exactly where
that would be with, and, and,

97
00:06:24.538 --> 00:06:28.200
giving you the ggplot commands
to create this same plot.
