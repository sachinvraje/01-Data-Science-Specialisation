00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.840
Okay, so let's go through
some simulation experiments

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.910
to understand how some of these
diagnostic measures work.

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.960
In this first case,

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.290
I'm looking at an instance where there's
a big cloud of uncorrelated data and

5
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.780
I did this by just generating a bunch
of pairs of independent random normals.

6
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.020
Then I added random standard then
I added the point at ten,ten which

7
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.990
clearly does not fit the rest
of the trend of data.

8
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.443
What we can see in this case is
that there's a strong correlation

9
00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:38.060
estimated by the data merely because
of the existence of this point

10
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.109
otherwise the correlation
would be estimated to be zero.

11
00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:52.290
So you can see the code right here that
I use to generate and plot the data.

12
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.500
So let's look at a couple of
the diagnostic values and

13
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.260
the first thing, why we look at
the DF datas, so here's the dfbetas,

14
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.150
the round statement here just rounds
into the third decimal place when I put

15
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.350
the three there and notice this first
point which is the ten, ten point is or

16
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.469
as the magnitude larger of a dfbeta then,
the remaining point.

17
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.260
Let's look at the hat values.

18
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.140
The hat value for this point is
much larger than the hat values for

19
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.170
the remaining points.

20
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.360
The hat values have to be between zero and
one.

21
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.830
So and it's of course much
larger than the other points.

22
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.847
So if we are looking at these,
we would obviously single this point out.

23
00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:54.505
Now let's look at another point,
another instance where there's a clear

24
00:01:54.505 --> 00:01:59.163
regression relationship, here I just
generated the data along a line, and

25
00:01:59.163 --> 00:02:05.000
then I generated another outlier that's
similarly distant from the cloud of data.

26
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.829
However it adheres very nicely
to the regression line.

27
00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.269
So let's see how our diagnostic
values look in this specific case.

28
00:02:18.807 --> 00:02:23.369
Okay, so here's my dfbetas and
if you look this first point,

29
00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.158
which was that outlying point.

30
00:02:26.158 --> 00:02:29.900
It's still large but

31
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.120
nowhere near as distinctively
large as in the other case.

32
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.130
So it still does appear to have
some influence in the fit, but

33
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.580
nothing like in the other case.

34
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.500
However if you look at
the hat values right.

35
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.670
If you look at the hat values,
this has a much larger hat value than and

36
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.130
the remaining all the other points.

37
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.000
A factor of ten than
most of the other points.

38
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.820
Why?

39
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.830
Well, if we go back what
we see is that this point

40
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.540
is outside of the range of the X values.

41
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.360
It's outside of the range of the X values.

42
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.690
But it does adhere to
the direction relationship.

43
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.820
So it's going to have
a large leverage value but

44
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.110
not a large DF beta or DFS or
some of these other things.

45
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.410
Let's look at this example by Stefanski
that to me shows why we do residual plots.

46
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.030
Basically, the reason we look at
residual plots is because they zoom

47
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.690
on potential problems with our model.

48
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.220
In this case you can download
the data from their website.

49
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.024
The pair Y scatter plots
are given here they show kind of

50
00:03:37.024 --> 00:03:40.568
nothing interesting other
than a lot of over plotting.

51
00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.650
Here I show my linear model fit and
if you look every single P

52
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.370
values highly significant for
every single coefficient here.

53
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.440
I set all of the data points but,
for this to work for this model,

54
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.180
you have to try to intercept in the way
that he generate with the data.

55
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.109
Okay, should we be done, is this fine,
well here's the problem.

56
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.030
So the residual plot that you intend to
do when you have multi variable examples

57
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.690
because you can't plop
the residuals versus the only

58
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.696
acts as you can in linear regression
is you need to pick a number

59
00:04:25.696 --> 00:04:30.510
of the X with the most common ways to plot
the residuals versus the fitted values but

60
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.300
residuals which are e vs y hat, okay.

61
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.640
So what happens in this
particular instance when we plot

62
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.815
the residuals versus y hat.

63
00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:44.910
Now you can see you get this very
clever little picture that comes out.

64
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.720
So what's happened?

65
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.350
Without looking at the residuals
we wouldn't have seen anything.

66
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.030
But looking at the residuals has
zoomed in on this very clear aspect of

67
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.320
poor model fit and

68
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.220
is a very clear systematic pattern
in our residuals that we've missed.

69
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.940
And remember in most cases in regression
we want to model the systematic things and

70
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.810
everything that we can explain,
we want to leave to,

71
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.630
we want to model this as if we're
noise but the systematic things like

72
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.240
obviously this picture is systematic
we want to actually be able to model.

73
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.610
So in this case without having
to look at the residual plot,

74
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.940
we would have missed this pattern.

75
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.820
It is really just created by
Stephansky and his co-authors to

76
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.660
described for
us why it is that we do residual plots and

77
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.460
that is that they zoom in ,so finally
on aspects of poor model fair.

78
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.970
So let's go back to the swiss data and
just look at the different

79
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.020
examples of diagnostic plots that
can spit out by default by art.

80
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.950
Remember at the beginning of
the lecture we started out with this so

81
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.400
let's see if now we can
interpret these things.

82
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.740
Well, for
the residual plot versus the fitted values

83
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.110
that's the same plot as we just saw
with the oriliow just a slide ago.

84
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.820
So what you're looking at in that plot is
trying to find anything that's systematic.

85
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.050
For example, if you saw the data
look something like that.

86
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.500
That would suggest heteroscedasticity

87
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.880
that the variance is either increasing or
decreasing.

88
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.050
In a way that you wouldn't like and so on.

89
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.360
So we in this plot it doesn't look so bad.

90
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.530
There doesn't seem to be
too many aspects of absence

91
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.079
of model departures there.

92
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:49.020
The Q-Q plot is specifically
designed to test normality or

93
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.010
not to test to evaluate normality
of the error terms, okay?

94
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.570
This scale location plot is plotting
the standardized residuals, remember we

95
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.970
talked about standardized residuals
they're the ordinary residuals but

96
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:08.250
standardize, so they have a more kind
of comparable scale across subject,

97
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.760
across experiments and the scale to try
and make them to be like a TY statistic.

98
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.880
So again, this is a lot like the residual
plot, you're applying them against

99
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.420
the fitted values but, now you just
mostly, you've change the scale.

100
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:30.733
So that's potentially useful for looking
at these across different experiments.

101
00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:36.660
The final is plot of
the Residuals vs Leverage.

102
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.500
So here's the standardized
Residuals on this scale and

103
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.680
then here's the Leverage on that scale and
in this plot

104
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:51.000
again you're trying to look at any sort of
systematic pattern any reason why points

105
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.280
with higher leverage are having higher or
particularly small residual values.

106
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.160
If you had an instance like where
you have plots like this and

107
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.660
you have one very high leverage point and
you get something like that.

108
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.320
That point might have
a very small residual but

109
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.870
unnecessarily while it has happened
to have very large leverage or

110
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.940
you might have an instance like this
where even though it's really impacted

111
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:23.170
the regression line, it still has high
leverage and also has a high residual.

112
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.930
So at any rate these are many, these are
just a couple of examples of the kind of

113
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:32.190
plots you might want to look at in
this data set none of them seem

114
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:39.170
to look too inherently bad but when you
go through these things ideally you

115
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:42.930
would have something where you could click
on the individual points and it would It

116
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:48.300
would describe the aspects of the point
when you hover over it with your mouse.

117
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.030
Some of the other software
systems can do that.

118
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.640
R can do that now,
we'll talk in the data products

119
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.590
class how you can actually
create those kinds of plots.

120
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.680
So that's the end of the lecture and

121
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.850
I look forward to seeing you next time,
but I hope now that you know a little bit

122
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.820
about diagnostic measures, and influence
diagnostics, and leverage diagnostics that

123
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.620
you can incorporate them into
your analysis in the future.

124
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.590
All right.
See you next time.
