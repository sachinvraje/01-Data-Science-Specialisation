1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.090
So let's move on to another example
of multi variable regression.

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.840
A very important example that underlies
the topic of so called ANCOVA.

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.070
I'd like to through an example to

4
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.620
illustrate fitting multiple lines with
different intercepts and different slopes.

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.640
So I'm going to use the swiss dataset
that we've looked at previously.

6
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.260
And recall we're trying
to model fertilities and

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.180
outcome as a linear function
of agriculture, which is

8
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.960
the percent of that province that was
working in agriculture as the predictor.

9
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.840
Remember that examination and

10
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.350
education really including those modified
the effect of agriculture and fertility.

11
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.140
For the time being, let's ignore that, and

12
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.810
I just want to show you how to fit
different lines, one for each group.

13
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.120
So let's take the Catholic variable.

14
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.950
So if I were, for example,
to do hist(swiss$Catholic),

15
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.270
notice that it's very bimodal.

16
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.420
And that's because most provinces
are either majority Catholic or

17
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.160
majority Protestant,
from this time period.

18
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.620
So now I'm going to create using dplyr,
a catholic,

19
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.140
binary catholic variable, which is one
if the province is majority catholic,

20
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.249
and zero if it's majority

21
00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:30.140
protestant.

22
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.140
CatholicBin variable, and
then now let me plot the data.

23
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.640
And what you see now is these
two variables, the CatholicBin

24
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.030
factor variable, that's zero for majority
Protestant and one for majority Catholic.

25
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.250
And you can see the data there, there
are some potential issues with the data.

26
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.190
And what I'm going to be describing
which is to fit lines to the data.

27
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.700
Particularly these outlyingish
looking observations.

28
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.790
But I'm going to ignore this now,
because later on in another lecture,

29
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.470
we are going to be talking about
outliers and influence points.

30
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.490
And then also, there's the impact
of these other variables,

31
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.470
how they would relate to these model fits.

32
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.310
So let's ignore all that for
the time being, and

33
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.845
simply work on fitting a line where
here now we want two separate lines.

34
00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:23.697
One for the majority

35
00:02:23.697 --> 00:02:29.360
Catholic provinces, and one for
the majority Protestant provinces.

36
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.760
Okay, so let's see if we can do that.

37
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.260
Let me describe some
models that we could fit.

38
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.920
So here I have given some notation.

39
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.450
Y is fertility, X1 is the percent of
the province working in agriculture,

40
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.930
and X2 is a binary variable, where it's
one if the province is over 50% catholic,

41
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.370
and zero if the province is
over Is majority Protestant.

42
00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.280
So consider model one, where we modeled
that our expected y, given x1 and x2,

43
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.460
is an intercept plus a slope times x1.

44
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.820
So that would just be a line,
and it would disregard

45
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.030
the religion of the province entirely.

46
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.200
Let's consider a second model.

47
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.300
Here we have expected of y given x1 and
x2 is

48
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.950
beta not plus beta 1 x1 plus beta 2 x2.

49
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.470
Now Let's think about this.

50
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.010
In the event that X two is equal to zero,
if the province is majority protestant.

51
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.180
Then this works out to be beta
knot plus beta one X one.

52
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.780
In the event that X two is equal to one.

53
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.870
In the event that the province is
majority Catholic, this works out to be

54
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.668
beta not plus beta2,
because this term right here is now one,

55
00:04:00.668 --> 00:04:04.870
plus beta1 X1.

56
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.890
So fitting this model,
the model that includes X1 and X2, but

57
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.610
no interaction Fits two models
that have the same slope.

58
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.290
These two models have the same slope,
but they have different intercepts,

59
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.100
beta not and then beta one plus
beta two for the second intercept.

60
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.480
Okay, let's consider one third model.

61
00:04:35.147 --> 00:04:39.691
I want now my expected outcome,

62
00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:44.739
given my predictors to be beta not,

63
00:04:44.739 --> 00:04:49.785
plus beta 1 X1, plus beta 2 X2,

64
00:04:49.785 --> 00:04:53.680
plus beta 3 X1 times X2.

65
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.060
Now, lets look at what
happens when X2 is zero,

66
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.780
this works out to be Beta0
the Beta1 is still there,

67
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.310
Beta1X1 is still there
Beta2X2 this term go to zero.

68
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.080
And beta 3 X1 times X2 is also zero,
because X2 is zero in both those cases.

69
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.360
Okay?

70
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.240
Now let's work on the case when X2 is 1,

71
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.040
which is the case when
the province is majority Catholic.

72
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.740
So we get beta not, plus beta 1 X1,

73
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.380
plus now beta 2 is this term is present,

74
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.940
because X2 is 1, and
this term is now beta 3 times X1,

75
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.459
because remember X2 is equal to one
in this case that we're considering.

76
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.100
Okay, now let's reorganize terms,
and that' s beta not plus beta two,

77
00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.780
there plus beta one plus beta three X one.

78
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.840
Okay, so what we've seen is if
we include in interaction term,

79
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.760
then we fit two lines, but
now those two lines have different slopes.

80
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.640
If we omitted that interaction term, we
fit two lines but they had the same slope.

81
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.910
If we include the interaction term,
two lines different slopes and

82
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.220
different intercepts.

83
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:26.949
And the coefficient in front of
the Catholic term by itself,

84
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.190
Is going to be the change in the intercept
going from Protestant to Catholic, right?

85
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.030
Here is the intercept for Protestant and
here is the intercept for Catholic.

86
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.510
And the beta three term,
the term in front of the interaction,

87
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.570
is going to be the change from the slope
going from Protestant to Catholic, right?

88
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.610
So the slope for the, When X2 equals one,
is beta one plus beta three.

89
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.860
It's going to have that
extra term in there.

90
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.320
Okay, so let's try it with some code and
I hope it will make sense.

91
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.370
And I think it's a little bit easier
to see when you actually do the code.
