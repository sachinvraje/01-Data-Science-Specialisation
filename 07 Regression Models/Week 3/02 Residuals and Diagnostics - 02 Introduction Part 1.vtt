Hi, and welcome to the class on Residuals,
diagnostics, and variation.

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.170
Remember we started out
with our linear model.

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.070
We're also going to assume here through
out the lecture that our errors

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.960
are normally distribute.

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.880
Some of our results require that and
some of them don't.

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.710
Remember how we defined our residuals and
that our estimate of residual

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.590
variation is the sum of the squared,
the average of the squared residuals.

8
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.450
Where remember we divide
by n-p rather than n, for

9
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.850
an biasness sake.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.580
So it's very easy in r to get
a plot of your residuals and

11
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:47.200
several plots that measure aspects
of model fit and lack of model fit.

12
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.660
So let's load up the data set swiss and

13
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.860
let's go ahead and fit the linear
model that includes all the terms and

14
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.620
the easy way to do that is to put
a period after the little tilde symbol.

15
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.830
So that, then it just includes
all the terms in the data frame

16
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.190
except the outcome of corps.

17
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.325
Then the generic command plot actually
will just plot the fit, it will plot and

18
00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:18.640
co-create a series of residual and
diagnostic plots for you.

19
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.430
I did par ama for all equals two two so
that it all it on one page.

20
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.320
So in this class we're going to go over
what the basics of these plots are.

21
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.080
So to do that we need to
discuss influential points and

22
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.310
outlier points and
that there's a distinction.

23
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.270
So here I've created a plot where there's
a clear linear relationship between

24
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.170
most of the data between the predictor and
the response.

25
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.810
So there's these four points that I'd like
to discuss that are colored in orange.

26
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.030
The first point let's look
at the lower left hand one,

27
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.860
is right in the middle
of the cloud of data.

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.370
It doesn't really have much influence or
leverage, okay?

29
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:11.930
So, to describe more on what influence
means, or what leverage means,

30
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.080
let's look at this point that
is in the upper right most plot.

31
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.670
Remember that our data has to go
through the average of the y's and

32
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.610
the average of the axis.

33
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.940
In that sense we can think of the average,
the two averages as

34
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.300
a mid point of fulcrum and that the bar

35
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.090
namely the regression line has to move
through that fulcrum and you could think

36
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.370
just like a regular physical fulcrum,
as you move further out, right?

37
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.226
That point will have
more leverage just like,

38
00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:50.310
I think it's probably
easier if I draw a picture.

39
00:02:55.887 --> 00:02:58.630
Here's my fulcrum.

40
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.206
Here's my heavy weight right here,
let's say it's one ton.

41
00:03:06.206 --> 00:03:11.750
Okay, if I need to lift up this weight,

42
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.860
if I push down right here on my bar,
it's going to be a lot harder,

43
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.950
than if I push down over there.

44
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.900
Well that is the same thing that
happens in regression models.

45
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.270
For if you have a bunch of data,
a datapoint that is,

46
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.650
here is the natural arrange of the axis,

47
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.420
a datapoint that's far outside of
the natural range of the axis.

48
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.370
This is would have high leverage.

49
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.930
A data point that's right in the middle
of the x's will have low leverage.

50
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.860
So the concept of leverage
is merely a concept

51
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.390
of how far away from the center
of the axis the data point is.

52
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.671
So influence on the other
hand is whether or

53
00:03:50.671 --> 00:03:54.326
not that point chooses
to exert that leverage.

54
00:03:54.326 --> 00:04:00.650
So this point that is far
along the regression line.

55
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.430
But still adheres very well

56
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.230
to the regression relationship that
would be observed if it was removed.

57
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.324
That point has high leverage but
it opts not to execute that leverage.

58
00:04:14.324 --> 00:04:17.470
On the other hand look at
this lower right hand point.

59
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.200
If that point were included
in the regression line

60
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.120
we would probably a larger fact on it.

61
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.720
Why?

62
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.142
Because it's outside of the clouded
points and it also doesn't adhere to what

63
00:04:28.142 --> 00:04:32.780
the rest of the date is saying now point
both has high leverage and high influence.

64
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.695
In this lecture we're going to go over
both the concepts of leverage and

65
00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:42.624
the concepts of influence and
how you diagnose them using your data.

66
00:04:42.624 --> 00:04:47.068
One final point to discuss is upper left
hand point that is right in the middle

67
00:04:47.068 --> 00:04:49.270
of the cloud or the X values.

68
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.359
So it has low leverage.

69
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.460
However, it doesn't adhere
at all to the relationship.

70
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.630
So, this upper left hand point,
while being an outlier, is not going to

71
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.110
exert the same influence on the model that
this lower right hand point is going to.
