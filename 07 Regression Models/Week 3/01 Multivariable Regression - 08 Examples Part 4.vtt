1
00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:06.410
Okay so
let's actually run some of these fits.

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.970
Lets first just fit the model that
doesn't include religion at all.

3
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.600
Okay so it's just fertility,
is a linear regression with agriculture.

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.730
Now I've already created my plot and
labeled it G, but

5
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.990
I want to save that plot so
I can keep adding different things to it.

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.680
So I'm going to assign that to G1.

7
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.610
And then I'm going to add to it
a line that grabs the intercept and

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.620
the slope from my new fitted,
from my new fit and then let me plot it.

9
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.166
Okay, so there's my fitted line, and
let me show you my coefficients summaries.

10
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.409
So I'm going to do summary of
my fitted linear aggression and

11
00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.936
I'm just going to grab
the coefficient table.

12
00:00:44.936 --> 00:00:49.334
So here's my intercept, it hits around 60,
you can see that right there,

13
00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:53.080
and then there's my agriculture
slope which is about 0.19.

14
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.780
Okay, so this just disregards
the color of the dots.

15
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.410
Let's do one now that
fits two parallel lines.

16
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.428
Okay, so now here my fit my
linear model fit is fertility

17
00:01:07.428 --> 00:01:12.170
as agriculture but
now my Catholic variable.

18
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.050
My percent of the province that's
Catholic that I've binarized.

19
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.970
I'm going to include it
as a factor variable.

20
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.610
Because this variable CatholicBin is 01,
remember back from the dummy variables

21
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.860
part of the lecture, I don't actually
have to have this factor statement.

22
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.070
Because coding a variable of 0
versus 1 treats it as a factor.

23
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.050
However I like to always call things
factor variables and the reason for

24
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.370
this is sometimes I have a variable that
012 for example for a 3 level variable.

25
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.310
And if I don't then call that a factor,

26
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.280
R is going to treat that
as a continuous regressor.

27
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.130
It's going to say 2 is twice 1,
even if 2 is just my numeric coding for

28
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.010
representing red hair color and
1 is for brown hair color.

29
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.070
Something like that,

30
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.200
where 2 really has nothing to do
with being twice 1 in that case.

31
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.690
So I like to get in the habit of
calling factor variables always

32
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.270
factor in my models just so
I don't make that mistake.

33
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.670
Now when you print out your summary,

34
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.610
you would hopefully notice that
there's only one coefficient.

35
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.530
And so you would hopefully notice
that you've made that mistake.

36
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.620
But this is an easy way to avoid it.

37
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.620
I don't maybe always live
up to this standard of

38
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.980
treating my factor variables
always with the factor statement.

39
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.830
But I try.

40
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.630
Okay.

41
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.890
So there I fit it.

42
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.010
And let's first look at the coefficients.

43
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.067
So here's the intercept.

44
00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:33.743
Here is the slope and the slope is
the same regardless of the religion

45
00:02:33.743 --> 00:02:38.174
of the province, and then here is
the change in the intercept for

46
00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:43.350
those that are Catholic, for
those provinces that are Catholic.

47
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.458
So let's go ahead and plot these.

48
00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:49.958
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy my old plot that's just the scatter

49
00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:54.845
plot and then I'm going to add two
lines to it, one that is the line for

50
00:02:54.845 --> 00:03:00.720
Protestants which is just the intercept
plus this Agriculture slope.

51
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.740
And then I'm going to add
one that is the line for

52
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.570
those provinces that
are majority Catholic.

53
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.610
So my intercept changes by adding the
first coefficient, which is the intercept

54
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.000
and the third coefficient which is this
7.88, but my slope stays the same.

55
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.550
It's just the same slope, so let me put
that in, and then now let me plot that.

56
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.480
And there you see what that looks like.

57
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.980
It's two fitted lines, where now I've

58
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.689
forced the fits to have different
intercepts but they have the same slope.

59
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.240
Now let's do some lines where they
have different intercepts and

60
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.120
different slopes depending on the percent
of the province that is Catholic.

61
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.440
So this one now, I put an asterisk and

62
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.850
I'll describe in a second
what this asterisk does.

63
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.840
So I did the fit.

64
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.670
Now I'm going to do the summary(fit)$coef,
maybe it's not the best practice

65
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.040
to keep naming your model fits the same
exact variable and overwriting it,

66
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.970
you probably want to save them.

67
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.368
So now look what happens.

68
00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:08.990
I have an intercept,
I have my slope, okay?

69
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.074
So this intercept is the intercept for
mostly Protestant provinces,

70
00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:18.222
the slope is the slope for
mostly Protestant provinces.

71
00:04:18.222 --> 00:04:24.903
This 2.86 plus 62,
that's going to be the intercept for

72
00:04:24.903 --> 00:04:28.578
the mostly Catholic provinces.

73
00:04:28.578 --> 00:04:32.885
And this slope plus this slope,

74
00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:37.519
0.1 basically, plus 0.9.

75
00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:42.930
That's going to be the slope for
the mostly Catholic provinces.

76
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.480
Because remember our coefficients added.

77
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.719
What happens when you add an asterisks
in between two variables in R?

78
00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.288
Is it automatically fits the interaction?

79
00:04:54.288 --> 00:04:55.834
So here's my interaction term.

80
00:04:55.834 --> 00:04:59.677
Here's my interaction term
plus all the main effects.

81
00:04:59.677 --> 00:05:03.486
And here's the main effect for Catholic,
here's the main effect for Agriculture and

82
00:05:03.486 --> 00:05:04.227
the intercept.

83
00:05:04.227 --> 00:05:06.883
I'll show you in a minute how you
can avoid doing that in R though,

84
00:05:06.883 --> 00:05:08.640
you want to be very
careful with doing that.

85
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.920
In general you want to include the main
effects, if you include the interaction.

86
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.110
Okay, so now let's plot those two lines.

87
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.103
So, here I'm going to assign

88
00:05:21.103 --> 00:05:24.930
my plot to be this original scatter
plot that I keep overriding.

89
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.090
Then I'm going to add two lines to it.

90
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.685
The first is the line for
the mostly Protestant provinces.

91
00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:34.740
They're my first coefficient
is the intercept and

92
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.160
my second coefficient is the slope.

93
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:44.830
Now I'm going to add a line that is the
line for the mostly Catholic provinces.

94
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.980
So here, Here is my Intercept.

95
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.180
Which is the first coefficient.

96
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.640
Right.
The first coefficient 62 here.

97
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.840
Plus the third coefficient.

98
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.240
Right.
The one,

99
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.160
this ones that's the Catholic main effect.

100
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.370
Okay.
And then the slope is going to be

101
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.830
the second coefficient.

102
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.689
Right.
This one right here.

103
00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:10.600
0.96 plus the fourth coefficient,

104
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.400
the interaction term that is the slope and
the province being mostly Catholic.

105
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.400
And let me plot it, there you see it.

106
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.220
And so now what we have is two different
intercepts and two different slopes.

107
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.289
You can see, of course,
that these lines are not parallel.

108
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.100
And you can see, so
you might not know which line is which but

109
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.577
we can guess from the coefficients right?

110
00:06:35.577 --> 00:06:39.064
So all the interaction terms,

111
00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:43.495
all the Catholic terms were positive.

112
00:06:43.495 --> 00:06:48.009
So this line with the slightly higher
intercept is going to be the Catholic line

113
00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:51.957
and this line for the slighty lower
intercept is going to be the mostly

114
00:06:51.957 --> 00:06:54.513
Protestant, so the salmon colored dots.

115
00:06:54.513 --> 00:06:57.455
Okay, now I think you can
probably see that well for

116
00:06:57.455 --> 00:07:01.151
the blue dots it's not clear what
these two blue dots over here,

117
00:07:01.151 --> 00:07:05.209
how they're impacting the fit, so
we might want to investigate that.

118
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.790
But that's for the next lecture
where we talk about residuals and

119
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.990
influence diagnostics and
that sort of thing.

120
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.847
The last thing I want to do.
