00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.586
Let's go through calculating residuals and
we're going to use the diamond dataset.

2
00:00:05.586 --> 00:00:09.087
Let's see.
So, our data is the diamond dataset.

3
00:00:09.087 --> 00:00:11.378
So let's do that.

4
00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:17.514
I'm going to redefine price as y,
x as carat and n as, as the length of the,

5
00:00:17.514 --> 00:00:22.462
the number of pairs, just so
I don't have to type so much.

6
00:00:22.462 --> 00:00:25.336
Now, I'm going to assign
to a variable named fit.

7
00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:32.420
I'm going to assign my linear regression
object that gets created from lm.

8
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.420
So let me do that.

9
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.178
Now the easiest way to get
the residuals is just do

10
00:00:40.178 --> 00:00:44.712
resid of fit, so
I'm going to define those as e.

11
00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:48.230
Let me show you another way to get
the residuals that of course has to do

12
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.086
the same thing.

13
00:00:49.086 --> 00:00:54.124
If I were to get my predicted fitted
values and remember, if I don't give

14
00:00:54.124 --> 00:00:59.243
the predict function new data,
if I just give it the output from lm, the,

15
00:00:59.243 --> 00:01:04.545
the assignment from ln, then it will
just predict at the observed x values.

16
00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:11.295
So yhat now is a vector of predictions
at the observed carat values.

17
00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:15.863
Now, I just want to show you that my
residual's calculated via the red,

18
00:01:15.863 --> 00:01:20.967
resid functions are the same as the
residuals that I'm calculating manually,

19
00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:23.420
which is just subtracting y and yhat.

20
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.042
So the way to do that is just take the
difference, the absolute differences and

21
00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:29.379
find the largest one.

22
00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:33.086
And I see that the largest one is on
the scale of 10 to the minus 13th.

23
00:01:33.086 --> 00:01:36.046
So, up to numerical precision,
it's the same thing.

24
00:01:36.046 --> 00:01:41.098
Then lastly, I just want to show
that if I manually even calculate

25
00:01:41.098 --> 00:01:45.777
the fitted values, coef fit 1 and
then coef fit 2 times x,

26
00:01:45.777 --> 00:01:50.753
that I of course will get very,
I get exactly the same numbers.

27
00:01:50.753 --> 00:01:53.254
So, up to numeric precision,
exactly the same.

28
00:01:53.254 --> 00:01:56.805
So the way you want to do it to
get the residuals is resid, but

29
00:01:56.805 --> 00:02:01.158
hopefully showing you this other
code will illustrate what's going on

30
00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:05.969
in the background with what res, the
actual calculation that resid is doing.

31
00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.753
Finally, let me show you that
the sum of my residuals is zero.

32
00:02:10.753 --> 00:02:14.961
Well, it's 10 to the minus 14th,
which is close enough to zero for me.

33
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:20.717
And then also the sum of my residuals
times the price variable x,

34
00:02:20.717 --> 00:02:22.961
that also has to be zero.

35
00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:24.378
Well, 10 to the minus 15th.

36
00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:29.586
So, up to numerical position
is zero in both cases.

37
00:02:29.586 --> 00:02:34.300
So the residuals are the sign lengths
of the red line that undershown

38
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.795
the following plot.

39
00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:39.039
And I'm going to do this using
base R graphics, just so

40
00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:42.003
I mix a little base R with
some ggplot graphics.

41
00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:48.797
So, I'm going to create my plot here,
there's my plot.

42
00:02:48.797 --> 00:02:53.725
I'm going to add the fitted line and in
base R, if you want to add the fitted line

43
00:02:53.725 --> 00:02:58.807
and you fit a regression line, you can
just do abline and put the object that you

44
00:02:58.807 --> 00:03:03.670
assign to the lm fit just as an argument
and it will add the regression line.

45
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.336
Here I want the line width to be two,
so it shows up a little bit better.

46
00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:10.909
And then I'm just going to for loop over,

47
00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.925
over the data values to
add in the red lines.

48
00:03:14.925 --> 00:03:17.336
Let me zoom in and show you that plot.

49
00:03:17.336 --> 00:03:19.378
There's my plot.

50
00:03:19.378 --> 00:03:26.795
Now my residuals are these red lines.

51
00:03:26.795 --> 00:03:30.725
These distances,
where if the point is above the line,

52
00:03:30.725 --> 00:03:32.994
the residual will be positive.

53
00:03:32.994 --> 00:03:37.253
And if the point is below the line,
the residual will be negative.

54
00:03:37.253 --> 00:03:43.586
This scatter plot isn't particularly
useful for assessing residual variation.

55
00:03:43.586 --> 00:03:46.385
Notice all of the blank
space in this part and

56
00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:51.086
this part of the graph, making the plot
kind of useless for that purpose.

57
00:03:51.086 --> 00:03:55.006
So, instead,
why don't we plot the residuals

58
00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:59.713
on the vertical axis versus
mass on the horizontal axis?

59
00:03:59.713 --> 00:04:06.920
Let's go ahead and
run the code and here's the plot.

60
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.711
Now we can see the residual
variation much more clearly.

61
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:15.632
When you look at a residual plot,
you're looking at,

62
00:04:15.632 --> 00:04:18.628
you're looking for any form of pattern.

63
00:04:18.628 --> 00:04:21.378
The residuals should
be mostly patternless.

64
00:04:21.378 --> 00:04:27.586
Also, remember that if we've included an
intercept, residuals have to sum to zero.

65
00:04:27.586 --> 00:04:32.050
So they have to lie above and
below this horizontal line at zero,

66
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.100
and you'd like them to be sort
of nicely in a random looking

67
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.503
fashion distributed both above and
below zero.

68
00:04:39.503 --> 00:04:43.503
We can see some interesting patterns
by honing in on the residual plot here.

69
00:04:43.503 --> 00:04:48.357
For example, we can see that
there were lots of diamonds of

70
00:04:48.357 --> 00:04:51.626
exactly the same mass measured in the,

71
00:04:51.626 --> 00:04:57.172
in this sort of gets lost in the scatter
plot by zooming in this way,

72
00:04:57.172 --> 00:05:00.671
we, we notice that particular feature.

73
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:06.467
Next, what we're going to go through
some pathological residual plots,

74
00:05:06.467 --> 00:05:10.753
just to highlight what
residual plots can do for you.

75
00:05:10.753 --> 00:05:13.595
So, I've concocted some examples that will

76
00:05:13.595 --> 00:05:17.795
help us to understand how residuals
can highlight in on model fit.

77
00:05:17.795 --> 00:05:22.390
So let's look in the R mark down file and
I'm going to show it again at the console

78
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.003
rather than going through the slides,
so you can actually watch me doing it.

79
00:05:27.003 --> 00:05:31.628
X here is just going to be
uniform from minus 3 to plus 3.

80
00:05:31.628 --> 00:05:36.361
So, I've created a x variable
that's just a kind of a random

81
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:40.503
smattering of points between
the values 3 and minus 3.

82
00:05:40.503 --> 00:05:43.870
My y is equal to x, so
it's an identity line, but

83
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.170
then I'm going to add
another term that's sin x.

84
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.998
So, it should look like an identity line,
but kind of oscillating around it a little

85
00:05:51.998 --> 00:05:55.133
bit and then I'm adding some
normal noise on top of it.

86
00:05:55.133 --> 00:06:01.295
So let me add my y and I'm going to switch
back to ggplot, because I like it better.

87
00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:04.836
So then base graphics now.

88
00:06:04.836 --> 00:06:07.628
So you, I've created my gg plot.

89
00:06:07.628 --> 00:06:11.829
I'm going to, I'm going to go ahead and
add the smooth first,

90
00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:16.800
because I want it as the bottom most layer
and then I'm going to add my two sets

91
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.128
of points and there's my,
there's my scatter plot.

92
00:06:21.128 --> 00:06:26.097
And so let me zoom in and it's a little
difficult to see the non-linearity,

93
00:06:26.097 --> 00:06:30.134
that sin x term is very,
it's a little apparent, but it's,

94
00:06:30.134 --> 00:06:32.170
it's kind of very hard to see.

95
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.235
I think if I was looking at this,

96
00:06:34.235 --> 00:06:38.836
I would immediately notice something
pattern asking the for fit here.

97
00:06:38.836 --> 00:06:42.170
But nonetheless,
it's maybe a little bit hard to see.

98
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.648
Before I move on to the residual plot,
let me make a comment.

99
00:06:45.648 --> 00:06:50.099
This model is actually the not, is, is,
is actually not the correct model for

100
00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:52.670
this data and
this might happen in practice.

101
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.461
This doesn't mean that this
model is unimportant, right?

102
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:58.759
There is a linear trend and
the model is accounting for it,

103
00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:02.879
it's just not accounting for
the secondary variation in the sign term.

104
00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:06.945
So, I just want to emphasize this in
regression modelling is just because you

105
00:07:06.945 --> 00:07:09.424
aren't fitting the actually correct model,

106
00:07:09.424 --> 00:07:12.045
that doesn't mean the model
is itself useless.

107
00:07:12.045 --> 00:07:16.760
You have about, you know, an average
identity line here that represents

108
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.336
the relationship between y and x and
it explains a lot of the variation.

109
00:07:21.336 --> 00:07:24.338
So, I just want to remind
you that in regression,

110
00:07:24.338 --> 00:07:28.086
having the exact right model is
not always the primary goal.

111
00:07:28.086 --> 00:07:32.253
You can get meaningful information
about trends from incorrect models.

112
00:07:32.253 --> 00:07:36.129
So, I just want to get that
statement out of the way, but

113
00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:38.753
now let's hone in on the residuals.

114
00:07:38.753 --> 00:07:41.413
So plot the residuals versus x and

115
00:07:41.413 --> 00:07:46.836
see if it makes this component of
the fifth sin x term more apparent.

116
00:07:46.836 --> 00:07:47.994
Okay.

117
00:07:47.994 --> 00:07:49.878
So let me plot the residual.

118
00:07:49.878 --> 00:07:52.086
The residual's versus the x variable.

119
00:07:52.086 --> 00:07:56.130
So just to describe what I have,
I'm going to assign g as my ggplot.

120
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.670
My x is in this case, x.

121
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.086
I have defined the x variable
as the variable named x.

122
00:08:02.086 --> 00:08:03.875
But now, my y is not the y variable, but

123
00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:06.379
it's going to be the residual
from the linear model fit.

124
00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:10.915
In here, I just grab it in that R command
right there, then my aesthetic for

125
00:08:10.915 --> 00:08:15.379
my ggplot, just has x and y as the names
of variables for the horizontal and

126
00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:17.045
vertical axis variables.

127
00:08:17.045 --> 00:08:19.528
So let me run that command and

128
00:08:19.528 --> 00:08:24.806
then I want to put a horizontal
line reference line at zero and

129
00:08:24.806 --> 00:08:29.874
then I want to add my points and
set the axes how I'd like and

130
00:08:29.874 --> 00:08:34.045
then let's see the plot and
there's the plot.

131
00:08:34.045 --> 00:08:35.961
Let me zoom in.

132
00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:37.551
And here is the plot and

133
00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:42.670
I think what you can see is that this
sign term is now extremely apparent.

134
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:46.446
That what the residual plot has done is,
it's zoomed in,

135
00:08:46.446 --> 00:08:50.687
on this part of the model inadequacy and
really highlighted it and

136
00:08:50.687 --> 00:08:54.795
that's one thing that residual
plots are especially good at.

137
00:08:54.795 --> 00:08:58.279
I'm going to show you another
one where by all appearances,

138
00:08:58.279 --> 00:09:00.420
the plot falls perfectly on a line.

139
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.003
But when you highlight in, at
the residuals, it looks quite different.

140
00:09:04.003 --> 00:09:11.586
So let me run the commands and
then I'll show you.

141
00:09:11.586 --> 00:09:16.192
So there's the plot and
then now, so look at that and

142
00:09:16.192 --> 00:09:21.336
it seems like the points fall
exactly on an identity line.

143
00:09:21.336 --> 00:09:26.371
Now let me highlight in on
the residuals and you see this

144
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:32.628
trend toward greater variability
as you head along the x variable.

145
00:09:32.628 --> 00:09:37.009
That property,
where the variability increases with the x

146
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:40.086
variables called heteroscedasticity.

147
00:09:40.086 --> 00:09:44.141
Heteroscedasticity is one of those things
that residual plots are quite good at

148
00:09:44.141 --> 00:09:46.086
diagnosing and you couldn't see it.

149
00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:49.256
If I go back to this earlier plot,
you can't see it at all here.

150
00:09:49.256 --> 00:09:51.878
Zoom in on the residuals and
there you see it there.

151
00:09:51.878 --> 00:09:55.464
Let me just zoom back here
to how I generated the data,

152
00:09:55.464 --> 00:09:57.545
just to illustrate it for you.

153
00:09:57.545 --> 00:10:02.795
My x variable is a bunch of
uniform random variables.

154
00:10:02.795 --> 00:10:06.920
My y variable is my x variable,
so an identity line.

155
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:13.081
But then when I added the errors,
the standard deviation of the errors,

156
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:17.020
look right here has the x
term involved in it and

157
00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:21.878
that's how I generated data
with heteroscedasticity.

158
00:10:21.878 --> 00:10:25.753
So let's run the residual plot for
the diamond data.

159
00:10:25.753 --> 00:10:31.505
So here, I'm just going to add a column
for the diamond data that is the residuals

160
00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:37.795
from regression model fit where price is
the outcome and carat is the predictor.

161
00:10:37.795 --> 00:10:44.920
So, I run that and now my data frame.

162
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:50.461
My data frame has carat price and
now the residuals.

163
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:54.462
So, I'm going to create my ggplot.

164
00:10:54.462 --> 00:10:58.754
My x label is going to be Mass in carats.

165
00:10:58.754 --> 00:11:01.249
My y label is going to
be Residual price and

166
00:11:01.249 --> 00:11:05.545
I just want to emphasize that the
residuals have the same units as the ys.

167
00:11:05.545 --> 00:11:08.795
So the residual price is
in Singapore dollars.

168
00:11:08.795 --> 00:11:11.170
I'm going to add my horizontal line.

169
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:17.086
I'm going to add my points and
then there's the plot.

170
00:11:17.086 --> 00:11:20.475
So there doesn't appear to be
a lot of pattern in the plot, so

171
00:11:20.475 --> 00:11:23.670
this, this is good it seems
like it's a pretty good fit.

172
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.120
Let me illustrate something
about variability in a diamond

173
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.235
dataset that will help
us set the stage for

174
00:11:31.235 --> 00:11:35.961
defining some new properties
about our regression model fit.

175
00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:41.170
So I'm going to create
now two residual vectors.

176
00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.878
The first residual vector is the one
where I just fit an intercept.

177
00:11:45.878 --> 00:11:53.095
So the residuals are just the deviations
around the average price,

178
00:11:53.095 --> 00:11:58.421
then I'm going to find
the residuals where I add in.

179
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:01.586
Our variation around the regression line.

180
00:12:01.586 --> 00:12:05.474
So the first one is variation
around the average price.

181
00:12:05.474 --> 00:12:09.878
The second is the variation around
the regression line with carats

182
00:12:09.878 --> 00:12:13.504
as the explanatory variable and
price as the outcome.

183
00:12:13.504 --> 00:12:18.586
So, I'm going to run that and
then I want to create

184
00:12:18.586 --> 00:12:23.920
a factor variable that
labels the set of residuals.

185
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.888
The first one is just going to be labeled
as a bunch of intercept only model

186
00:12:28.888 --> 00:12:34.019
residuals and the second set are going to
be labeled as a bunch of intercept and

187
00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:37.378
slope residuals,
then I want to create a ggplot.

188
00:12:37.378 --> 00:12:44.128
My, with this data frame, my y
variable is going to be the residuals.

189
00:12:44.128 --> 00:12:47.753
My x variable is going to be the fit,
which is the two fits it is.

190
00:12:47.753 --> 00:12:51.276
Linear model or
linear model with just an intercept or

191
00:12:51.276 --> 00:12:55.045
the linear model with carat,
the mass as the predictor.

192
00:12:55.045 --> 00:13:01.836
And I want to fill in my points based on
the color, based on the which fit it was.

193
00:13:01.836 --> 00:13:07.004
So, I'm going to do that and then
the kind of plot I want is a dot plot and

194
00:13:07.004 --> 00:13:10.753
then I want to put my axes
labels the way I'd like.

195
00:13:10.753 --> 00:13:13.211
Now let's see the plot.

196
00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:14.712
There it is.

197
00:13:14.712 --> 00:13:20.308
So what we see on this left-hand
plot with just the intercept

198
00:13:20.308 --> 00:13:26.795
is the variation in diamond prices
around the average diamond price.

199
00:13:26.795 --> 00:13:31.336
So just the, basically the variation
in diamond prices from the sample.

200
00:13:31.336 --> 00:13:33.718
What we're seeing in the rightmost plot,

201
00:13:33.718 --> 00:13:37.503
this is displaying the variation
around the regression line Mind.

202
00:13:37.503 --> 00:13:42.340
So what we've done is we've
explained a lot of this

203
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.628
variation with the relationship with mass.

204
00:13:46.628 --> 00:13:51.547
And what we're going to talk about next is
r squared, which basically says, we can

205
00:13:51.547 --> 00:13:56.468
decompose this total variation, this
variation in the y's by themselves leaving

206
00:13:56.468 --> 00:14:01.109
you with just the mean into the variation
explained by the regression model and

207
00:14:01.109 --> 00:14:05.711
the variation that's left over after
accounting for the regression model.

208
00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:09.472
So this is the variation that's left over
after counting for the regression, but

209
00:14:09.472 --> 00:14:13.288
also this sort of subtraction of these two
would be the variation that was explained

210
00:14:13.288 --> 00:14:14.503
by the regression model.

211
00:14:14.503 --> 00:14:19.711
But there's a formula for that and
we're going to dive into that next.
