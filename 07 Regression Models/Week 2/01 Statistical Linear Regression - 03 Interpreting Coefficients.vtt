00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.680
Now that we have a formal statistical
framework, we can interpret our regression

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.240
coefficients with respect
to that framework.

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.020
Take for example, the intercept.

4
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.410
It's the expected value Y
given that the regressor is 0.

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.200
And here I'm simply
plugging into the formula.

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.120
Note that the regressor
being equal to zero is often

7
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.450
not of interest in the study.

8
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.590
For example, if the regression
variable is blood pressure, probably

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.210
you're not interested in the response for
among people with blood pressure of zero.

10
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.070
However, there is an easy fix for this.

11
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.180
Consider just shifting our
regression variable by a constant a.

12
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.336
And here in this equation,
I've just subtracted off an a here.

13
00:00:41.336 --> 00:00:45.546
Which means I have to add an a beta
1 over here to have done nothing,

14
00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:47.134
to have simply added 0.

15
00:00:47.134 --> 00:00:51.945
Well this is exactly rewriting
the aggression equation

16
00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:55.846
as beta not tilde plus
beta 1 times x minus a.

17
00:00:55.846 --> 00:01:00.558
A new regression line with a new
intercept, the same slope, and

18
00:01:00.558 --> 00:01:04.040
my regressor now shifted by a constant a.

19
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.960
So this goes to show you that if you
shift your regressor by a constant,,

20
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.180
it doesn't change the slope,
however it does change the intercept.

21
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.670
Now the intercept is inter,
interpreted not when x is zero, but

22
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.140
when x is this value
that you shifted it by a.

23
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.360
A very common constant
to due is the average.

24
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.910
Set a equal to the average
of the X variable.

25
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.510
Then your intercept will be
interpreted as the expected

26
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.430
value of the response when the regressor
is at the average value of the Xs.

27
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.450
Let's see if we can figure out
a model-based interpretation of our

28
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.179
regression coefficient.

29
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.880
Now, it's a slope so it must have
an interpretation that is of the form,

30
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.820
the change in Y per unit change in X.

31
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.963
So let's see if we can work with that.

32
00:01:48.963 --> 00:01:51.254
Take the expected value of Y,

33
00:01:51.254 --> 00:01:56.120
given that X takes the value x plus 1,
a one unit increase in X.

34
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.679
And subtract off from the expected value
of Y, given that X takes the value x.

35
00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.887
Well, that works out to be beta
naught plus beta 1 times x plus1,

36
00:02:05.887 --> 00:02:08.957
minus beta naught plus beta 1 times x.

37
00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:11.935
Do the arithmetic and
that works out to be beta 1.

38
00:02:11.935 --> 00:02:16.724
So, beta 1 is the expected
change in the response per unit

39
00:02:16.724 --> 00:02:19.766
change in the regression variable.

40
00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:23.811
And that, so it has a nice interpretation,
it's not that different from the regular

41
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:26.733
interpretation of a line,
just now with the expected value,

42
00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:29.110
the conditional expected
value of the response.

43
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.500
Now, remember, if we shift the X variable,
it doesn't change the slope,

44
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.990
we discussed that on the previous slide.

45
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.010
What if we scaled the regression variable?

46
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.020
And it usually only we're usually scaling
by number, say a, that's positive.

47
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.030
So, what we can do is simply multiply and
divide by a, and we can rewrite our

48
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.220
progression equation as beta naught plus
beta 1 tilde times X times a plus epsilon.

49
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.244
So, we've multiplied X by a and

50
00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:01.976
our regression slope has
now been divided by a.

51
00:03:01.976 --> 00:03:06.657
So in other words, multiple,
multiplication of a regression variable by

52
00:03:06.657 --> 00:03:10.609
a factor a results in dividing
the coefficient by a factor of a.

53
00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:17.790
Let me give you a simple example, so
to hopefully solidify these points.

54
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.935
Imagine if X's height
measured in meters and

55
00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:26.168
Y's weight measured in kilograms,
a pretty simple regression problem.

56
00:03:26.168 --> 00:03:30.390
Then beta 1 is interpreted
in kilograms per meter.

57
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.500
Converting X to centimeters
implies multiplying X by

58
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.620
100 centimeters per meter.

59
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.620
To get beta 1 in the right units,
now we simply divide

60
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.990
it by 100 centimeters per meter to get it,
to, to, to get it back on the right scale.

61
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.830
And here I just wrote a,
a little equation to remind us.
