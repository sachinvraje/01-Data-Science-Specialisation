00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.040
Okay, so let's look at
logistic regression curves and

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.740
think about how r is fitting the data.

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.708
So here I'm going to use
the package manipulate.

4
00:00:16.712 --> 00:00:20.860
And i have my beta2 and
my beta1, set here.

5
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.344
And so
here's my logistic regression curve,

6
00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:27.900
looks like an s kind of, and here's beta1.

7
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.296
So let's see what happens as I render it.

8
00:00:34.254 --> 00:00:35.970
Or as I change it.

9
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.886
Notice as I get it closer up to higher
values, it becomes more peaked, okay?

10
00:00:42.886 --> 00:00:48.050
And then if I go negative,
it actually flips around, okay?

11
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.590
And then my beta0 curve,
what happens to this?

12
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.680
It just shifts it along.

13
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.170
It's hard to tell because
I'm keeping the don't.

14
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.930
The x-axis here is always the same, but

15
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.470
it's just shifting the s-curve
to the left or to the right.

16
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.055
Let's think about what r is
doing when it's trying to fit

17
00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:15.546
logistic regression curves.

18
00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:23.497
Imagine I have a bunch of zeros and
ones, on my x-axis one is up here, and

19
00:01:23.497 --> 00:01:25.490
zero is down there.

20
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.260
So imagine for this regressor,
this x-regressor here, I have a bunch of

21
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.480
zeros down there, but maybe and
an occasional one, some, but

22
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.040
then over here, I have a lot more ones,

23
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.590
and then right here I have some zeros,
okay?

24
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.190
So what r is trying to do, okay?

25
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.150
So it knows as I head,
we can see as I head to larger x values,

26
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.420
it become increasingly likely
that my outcome is a one.

27
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.420
As I head towards smaller x values,

28
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.220
it becomes increasingly likely
that my outcome is a zero.

29
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:15.220
So what r is trying to do is
trying to move the s-curve.

30
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.070
It's trying all different
sorts of s-curves, right?

31
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.360
All different sorts of logistic
curves to find the one that best

32
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.430
matches up with the associated
probabilities, okay?

33
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.450
And that's all that logistic
regression is trying to do.

34
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.350
And it does it with the principle
of so-called maximum likelihood.

35
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.760
Which again is something if
you take the inference class

36
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.800
from the data science specialization,
you'll know a little bit more about.

37
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.380
So just imagine these
points staying there, and

38
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.050
I'm going to get rid of them, okay?

39
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.280
And then just see what r
has under its disposal

40
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.280
is to be able to move these two sliders,
and

41
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.140
then define the s-curve that
fits that data the best, okay?

42
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.790
And so that's all that
logistic regression is doing.

43
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.920
And this function,
this the fitted function out, right?

44
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.961
This is the function.

45
00:03:15.754 --> 00:03:21.945
E to the Beta not, plus beta 1x over one,
plus e to the beta not,

46
00:03:21.945 --> 00:03:27.568
plus beta 1x,
that's the logistic regression model but

47
00:03:27.568 --> 00:03:32.770
converted back to the probability scale,
okay?

48
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.420
So, I hope this helps you understand
a little bit of behind the scenes,

49
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.000
what logistic regression is trying to do.
