1
00:00:03.427 --> 00:00:08.756
So we've created our first lesson and
we have tested it, let's get

2
00:00:08.756 --> 00:00:15.320
into some of the more complicated question
types that you can ask in a swirl lesson.

3
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.359
And I want to start a new lesson,
so in order to do that,

4
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.765
I can close this lesson.yaml file, and

5
00:00:25.765 --> 00:00:31.350
I want to create a lesson in
the course that I'm working on.

6
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.960
So just to remind myself of what course
I'm working on, I'm going to use

7
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.825
the get_current_lesson function, and
that just returns some data about what

8
00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:46.530
lessons and what course swirl
knows it's working on right now.

9
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.424
So my course is called My First Course,
so let's start a new lesson.

10
00:00:53.424 --> 00:00:57.680
We're going to call this lesson Lesson 2,
and

11
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.051
this is still in the My First Course,
course.

12
00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.680
All right, so,
we've got a new lesson here.

13
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.910
I forgot to mention this before,

14
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.200
but this first question that gets
generated is called the meta question.

15
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.660
The student never sees it, but

16
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.140
you can just provide some information
inside of the meta question.

17
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.587
So I'm going to fill out these fields
of the author and the organization.

18
00:01:32.586 --> 00:01:38.600
All right, so now, let's take a look at
some more complicated question types.

19
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.150
For example, if I wanted to write
a multiple choice question,

20
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.300
I could use wq_multiple, and
then coming over here to edit it,

21
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.559
I could ask any kind of
multiple choice question here.

22
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.920
So, a simple question like,

23
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.880
Which of these shapes has four sides?

24
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.510
And then, I can separate the different
answer choices with semi-colons.

25
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.823
So I'm going to say, Square;Circle.

26
00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:26.136
The answer is Square, and

27
00:02:26.136 --> 00:02:32.178
the answer test here is just
repeating what the correct answer is.

28
00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:40.931
And then for the hint,
I can just write anything.

29
00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:47.310
I'm going to give a very unhelpful hint.

30
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.110
All right, so I'm going to add this
lesson to the course manifest.

31
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.980
Then let's quickly run test_ lesson.

32
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.600
We've got no errors.

33
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.110
And now let's run demo_lesson.

34
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.578
Which of these shapes has four sides?

35
00:03:09.578 --> 00:03:11.630
I have to pick 1, 2, or 3.

36
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.660
If I pick 2, I get the wrong answer.

37
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.600
So I'm going to answer square,
and that's the end of the lesson.

38
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.840
Now I'd like to write
a figure type question.

39
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.190
So I'm going to type into
the R console wq_figure.

40
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.250
And that will add a figure question
template to my lesson.yaml.

41
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.249
So the message that I'm going to
output to the user is just

42
00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.736
going to say, This is a simple graph.

43
00:03:42.921 --> 00:03:46.787
And then there are two more fields
that are part of this question,

44
00:03:46.787 --> 00:03:49.320
the Figure and the FigureType.

45
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.650
So the Figure is an R script that I
will include in the lesson directory.

46
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.575
And whatever code is in that R
script will be executed in order

47
00:03:59.575 --> 00:04:02.800
to show a figure to the student.

48
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.092
And then this FigureType
just specifies new to

49
00:04:07.092 --> 00:04:11.220
show that this is going
to be a new figure.

50
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.990
In other words, we're not going to
be building at all on this figure.

51
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.500
So first, let me add this figure file.

52
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.904
I'm going to call this file fig1,
and now let's go over to the Finder.

53
00:04:27.904 --> 00:04:30.317
Actually, let me open up a new R script,
in fact,

54
00:04:30.317 --> 00:04:32.164
I have an entitled script right here.

55
00:04:32.164 --> 00:04:37.574
And I'm just going to make
a very quick plot, and

56
00:04:37.574 --> 00:04:44.789
then I'm going to save this in
My First Course > Lesson_2,

57
00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.780
and we're calling it fig1.R,
perfect, okay.

58
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.041
So let's demo this lesson again.

59
00:04:58.453 --> 00:05:07.730
So I have to pick square, and then, as
you can see, It draws a very simple plot.

60
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.793
Now let's say that I wanted to add
something to this plot after I drew it.

61
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.617
I can add another figure question,
so I'm going to say,

62
00:05:24.185 --> 00:05:28.979
wq_figure to add another figure question

63
00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.140
template, and
then I'm going to add a line.

64
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:40.328
So, what I'm going to show the user
is just the text, I added a line!

65
00:05:42.703 --> 00:05:49.690
I'm going to write the code for
adding this line in a file called fig2.R.

66
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.310
And this FigureType is add,
instead of new.

67
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.325
Those are the only true choices
that there are for FigureType.

68
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.863
So let me then open up a new script,

69
00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:07.280
and I'm just going to say abline,

70
00:06:13.225 --> 00:06:19.820
(h = 5, col = "red").

71
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.862
We'll save that as fig2.R.

72
00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:28.947
All right, so
let me demo the lesson one more time.

73
00:06:32.063 --> 00:06:35.407
Circle, square,

74
00:06:35.407 --> 00:06:39.928
here's a drawing of the graph.

75
00:06:39.928 --> 00:06:41.566
And then, it draws the line.
