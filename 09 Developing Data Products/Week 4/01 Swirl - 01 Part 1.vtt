Hello, I'm Sean Cross and
I'm going to show you

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.210
how to start writing your own Swirl
courses and Swirl lessons with Swirlify.

3
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.500
If you're not familiar with Swirl,

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.660
it's an R package that turns the R console
into an interactive learning environment.

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.027
Let me give you a short tour of Swirl
in case you haven't used it before.

6
00:00:22.027 --> 00:00:25.536
So let me load the Swirl package and

7
00:00:25.536 --> 00:00:31.475
then I can just start up Swirl
by using the swirl function.

8
00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:35.489
And as you can see,
the R console starts talking to me and

9
00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.462
asking me some questions.

10
00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:38.720
So you can call me Sean.

11
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.260
I don't want to.

12
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.590
I was working on a lesson before.

13
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.830
As you can see, I get a selection,

14
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.820
I get a couple options to pick
a Swirl course to start, so

15
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.420
I'm going to pick R Programming, and then
within that course I can pick a lesson.

16
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.110
I'm going to start the,
first lesson, Basic Building Blocks.

17
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.470
So the R console starts displaying some
text as I get into the Swirl lesson.

18
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.250
The console in Swirl wants me to

19
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.920
type in 5 + 7 and I did that correctly,

20
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.660
so I got the question right so
we can move on to further questions.

21
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.220
Now Swirl wants me to assign
the value of 5 + 7 to a variable x.

22
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.890
So I'm going to do the wrong
things to show you what happens.

23
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.030
I'm going to assign 5 + 8.

24
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.824
And as you can see, it says, nice try,

25
00:01:41.824 --> 00:01:45.540
I didn't get the question right,
and it shows me a hint.

26
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.000
So I'm going to follow that
hint's advice and type 5 + 7.

27
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.100
All right, so
it's a short introduction to Swirl.

28
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.940
There are several different
kinds of questions that

29
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.670
the R console can ask a student.

30
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.417
So I'm going to exit out of
this lesson right now, and

31
00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:06.511
I did that using the Escape key,
by the way.

32
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:10.671
And, I'm going to show you how you can
start writing your own Swirl lessons with

33
00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:11.313
Swirlify.
