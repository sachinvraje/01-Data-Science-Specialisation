00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.480
So, the last thing that's kind of
an important thing to cover in Shiny,

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.870
is delayed reactivity.

3
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.640
So, we run into this problem a lot,

4
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.730
where we've developed an app,
and Shiny's reactivity,

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.720
the way it works with reactivity, as soon
as you're changing your slider values,

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.309
it's automatically re-executing
the code in the server functions.

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.018
Which is fine if what's going on in
the server functions are really small,

8
00:00:26.018 --> 00:00:27.270
quick calculations.

9
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.890
And often, that's what you want.

10
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.040
But sometimes, your Shiny app is running
a large Monte Carlo simulation, or

11
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.290
it's doing Bootstrap, or something
computationally intensive, and you want

12
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.430
to have them settle the values, then click
a submit button or something like that.

13
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.080
So, we're going to show you
how to do this really quick.

14
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.890
It's only going to be
one extra line of code.

15
00:00:47.127 --> 00:00:52.767
Okay, here I have my code exactly
from the previous example,

16
00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:55.920
and just set in the same exact way.

17
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.980
So, if I click Run App,
you'll recognize the app.

18
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.030
It just looks, and
as I change the slider, it goes ahead and

19
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.880
reruns the code, okay?

20
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.920
So, what we want to change now,
is to have a submit button.

21
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:19.630
So, from the slides,
I'm going to add this one command.

22
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.170
Okay?

23
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.040
submitButton.

24
00:01:22.512 --> 00:01:26.970
Okay, so just the command here,
submitButton.

25
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.920
And then,
the button value is called Submit.

26
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.580
And then, this actually receives a labeled
input value, called Submit, that you can

27
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.530
use, for example, if the submitButton
is true, in your server functions.

28
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.160
Now, one thing that's a very
common mistake when you're

29
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.170
doing Shiny apps is not remembering
that these are functional arguments.

30
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.490
So, not remembering that you have to
have a comma after all these commands.

31
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.050
Okay.

32
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.330
So notice, RStudio is kind enough.

33
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.605
Let me see.

34
00:01:57.605 --> 00:02:00.820
Before, it was showing me that
there was an error there.

35
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.530
There you go.

36
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.350
See this little x there?

37
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.548
That's that error.

38
00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:08.050
Expect a comma after the expression.

39
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.510
Right there, okay.

40
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.830
So, without that comma, it wouldn't run.

41
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.370
Okay, so now let's run the app.

42
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.480
And, okay,
see now we have a little Submit button.

43
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.340
And as we change the value of the slider,
notice it doesn't rerun.

44
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.840
We have to click Submit,
and then it reruns.

45
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.810
Okay?

46
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.510
So, that's a very useful thing.

47
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.310
And, again, remember your Submit
button is a label button that you can

48
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.480
refer back to in your server functions.

49
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.500
So if you want calculations or
things conditional on the Submit button,

50
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.530
you can do that.

51
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.280
Okay, so that's a quick little handy thing
that you can add into your Shiny tools.
