1
00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.850
Okay, so
our last example was kind of silly.

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.210
In that, the function really do anything,
it just have a button that you click and

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.710
then it was done.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.210
And it just took you back to the R prompt.

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.830
It also has a cancel button by
default that will stop the gadget and

6
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.070
just return your R prompt
to quit the server running.

7
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.040
Okay, so now let's just show you how
you can include some arguments in your

8
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.290
Shiny Gadget, and we're going to do
some just simple manipulations of

9
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.400
course just because we're going to try and
show it in its simplest version, and

10
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.420
I think once you get
the gist of how to code it,

11
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.830
then you can figure out how to
do it with your own application.

12
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.974
So, let's go through the code.

13
00:00:38.974 --> 00:00:43.530
The code here has two parts because it
was just hard to fit on the screen.

14
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.600
So, here's the first part, and
then the second page is the second part.

15
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.490
So remember, of course,
our shiny gadget has to have the UI part,

16
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.630
in this case we're again doing mini page.

17
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.614
And then the server part, okay?

18
00:00:56.614 --> 00:01:01.265
And of course, we have to have

19
00:01:01.265 --> 00:01:05.917
our two libraries loaded up so

20
00:01:05.917 --> 00:01:12.070
just make sure, you have that, okay.

21
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.726
So, our gadget title is just
going to be multiply to numbers

22
00:01:16.726 --> 00:01:20.510
are a content panels so
this is new right here.

23
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.320
Mini content panels so

24
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.060
that's just going to be main body
of the little pane there, okay.

25
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.070
And it's going to have selector input,
which is going to be like a drag down box,

26
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.610
and it's going to have two variables, the
variable one is going to be labeled num1,

27
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.948
and num2, so if we have to reference them
later, they're going to have that name.

28
00:01:43.948 --> 00:01:50.400
And then these are the displayed labels
and the choices are right here and

29
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.400
the choices come from this two arguments
right here in the function, okay.

30
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.733
So, that's going to display
our user-interface.

31
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:05.660
And then our server, okay.

32
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.000
Again, it's going to have input,
output, and session.

33
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.350
We're still going to have the input$done.

34
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.150
Variable in the observe event, just to let
Shiny know that when it's done to quit.

35
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.360
And then, we're going to remember
to have this curly braces here.

36
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.021
Remember that kind of odd
syntax that Shiny has.

37
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:31.043
So just probably the number one
mistake everyone makes in coding Shiny

38
00:02:31.043 --> 00:02:35.336
applications is forgetting to put
the curly braces in, in the right spot or

39
00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:38.287
forgetting to close a brace and
that sort of thing.

40
00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:43.727
Okay, so we're just going to actually
name in this environment a num1 and

41
00:02:43.727 --> 00:02:49.711
num2 as the just input values just so
that there are easier to work with, okay.

42
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.130
And then we're going to
multiply them together.

43
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.850
And the stopApp function is just
going to tell it to stop and

44
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.950
display the result of
num1 multiply times num2.

45
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.200
And remember we have to have
a runGadget in there and

46
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.810
it specify what is the UI and
what is the server.

47
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.730
So technically you could name UI and
server something else.

48
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.090
But by convention I
think no one does that.

49
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.810
Okay, so let's go to the code
demonstration and see how it works.

50
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.040
Okay, so I have my function that I
copied from the R mark down document.

51
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.380
Let's just make sure I've got
the two libraries loaded.

52
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.190
Okay, now let's run our function.

53
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.730
I've already run it before, I'm sorry,
I already went over all the components

54
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.010
before, but now let's actually
see what happens when we run it.

55
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.940
Okay, so, obviously nothing, because
this is just defining the function.

56
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.900
Now let's do it, there is it, good.

57
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.950
And let's give as choices
the numbers 1:10 and 1:10.

58
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.173
Let's say we're learning our
multiplication tables and

59
00:03:52.173 --> 00:03:54.681
we want this to help us check them.

60
00:03:54.681 --> 00:03:59.520
So I want to do 4 and 7,
hopefully it will give me 28.

61
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.190
And then when I click done.

62
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.710
Go back in the R pane, see it gave you 28.

63
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.830
Okay, so this is just a baby step
towards some really useful things.

64
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.620
But we were able to put in some choices,
select among them and

65
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.720
then have R do some numeric
manipulations and spit them out.

66
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.780
And I am hoping now you can start to
see the direction that Shiny gadgets

67
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.230
is going to go from here to
actually be useful for you.

68
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.910
So next we'll actually do
an interactive graphic.
