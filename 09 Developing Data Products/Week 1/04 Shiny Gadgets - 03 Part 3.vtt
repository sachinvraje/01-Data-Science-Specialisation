1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.060
Okay, so one of the most useful things
we can do with Shiny gadgets is

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.920
create interactive plots.

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.190
Now I know many of you are familiar with
Shiny syntax because we've already done

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.010
the modules on Shiny.

5
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.640
So we're not going to spend a lot of time
re-doing that in the context of Shiny

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.180
gadgets.

7
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.630
We're just going to go over one example,
and hopefully you'll be able to build and

8
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.330
generalize off of those using your
knowledge of Shiny and a little bit of

9
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.590
extra syntax that we need for
Shiny gadgets to put the two together and

10
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.570
do what you need in using Shing
gadgets as will be useful for you.

11
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.870
So what we want to do
in this example is plot

12
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.080
the trees data set, and
plot the girth by volume, and

13
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.000
have a cross hair where we can
select a rectangle, and that

14
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.380
our function will then output a data
frame of the trees from that rectangle.

15
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.339
Okay, so let's try and do this.

16
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.382
So again, we as always have to do

17
00:01:05.382 --> 00:01:11.022
library(shiny) and library(mini) UI.

18
00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:14.740
Our shiny gadget is a function, okay?

19
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.350
And we have to have a user interface.

20
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.077
And it's going to be
minipage from the mini UI.

21
00:01:20.077 --> 00:01:25.234
We have a Title bar, gadgetTitleBar,
select points by dragging your mouse.

22
00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:29.158
And then in the miniContentPanel, so

23
00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:34.061
just in the main content
panel of our Shiny app,

24
00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:36.880
we're going to have a plot and

25
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.800
the name of that plot is going to be plot,
okay?

26
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.100
So, and
we'll refer back to that here in a second,

27
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.830
when we get to the second
part of the code, okay?

28
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.159
We want the height to be 100%.

29
00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.412
Just because that's going to make it look.

30
00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:54.720
That's going to make it take up
as much of the page as we can.

31
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.382
And then this is an option is
to actually have the brush.

32
00:01:58.382 --> 00:02:01.160
That's going to be the crosshairs
that select the point.

33
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.620
But notably, we're going to
name the brush, brush, okay?

34
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.130
So let's go to the server and remember
those two things we named plot and

35
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.920
brush, okay?

36
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.500
Where do those named outputs,

37
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.022
where do those named inputs come in,
in our server function?

38
00:02:19.022 --> 00:02:27.563
Okay, output$plot Is going to
be this renderPlot statement.

39
00:02:27.563 --> 00:02:33.270
And remember from Shiny, when we
render a plot to be displayed, it has

40
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.657
to have this kind of reactive notation
of a parenthesis then curly braces, and

41
00:02:39.657 --> 00:02:45.140
you've gotta get them both,
otherwise it will give you an error.

42
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.300
So we're going to plot, the actual plot
that we're going to plot is going to plot

43
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.360
the data set trees girth by volume.

44
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.190
The title is going to be trees and

45
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.430
it's going to have an x label of girth and
a y label of volume.

46
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.788
Okay, so that's the plot that's
going to get passed back to the UI with

47
00:03:03.788 --> 00:03:05.960
the variable named plot.

48
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.995
And then observeEvent, again we're
going to finish the app if it's done,

49
00:03:10.995 --> 00:03:15.930
okay, and
we have our curly braces right here again.

50
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.145
And then we are going to stop
the app after we collect

51
00:03:21.145 --> 00:03:26.968
the brush points which is just
after we select a rectangle

52
00:03:26.968 --> 00:03:31.956
from the trees data set and
the input is $brush.

53
00:03:31.956 --> 00:03:36.565
That's the variable from before when we
declared in our plots statement in UI and

54
00:03:36.565 --> 00:03:38.280
named our brush, brush.

55
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.230
This is what we're using it here,
that's the input.

56
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.500
And then the xvar and the yvar here
have to be named the same thing.

57
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.840
And they have to be the correct
names from the data set trees, okay.

58
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.660
And then we have our run gadget statement.

59
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.520
So let's run this and see what it does and

60
00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.346
hopefully you can see that this is kind of
starting to become a pretty useful tool.

61
00:04:01.346 --> 00:04:05.380
Okay, so we're going to load up Shiny and
mini UI.

62
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.670
And again, you only have to do this
once if you've done it before.

63
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.890
If you have multiple gadgets.

64
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.692
But I'm doing it every time because
I'm often restarting the R server.

65
00:04:14.692 --> 00:04:17.790
Or I'm sorry,
I'm off to restarting the R session.

66
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.400
So here's my Shiny gadget function,
pick trees.

67
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.605
Okay, now let me run it.

68
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.527
Doesn't take any arguments, there it is,
starts at the little server, and

69
00:04:33.527 --> 00:04:34.910
here is my plot.

70
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:42.530
Okay, now what I can do is select say this
collection of points right here, okay?

71
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.330
And now that I've selected it and
I can actually move it around by the way.

72
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.683
But I want those points right there and

73
00:04:50.683 --> 00:04:54.229
you can move the box in, okay.

74
00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.990
Then when I click done,
and I go over here.

75
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.355
It's giving me those data points.

76
00:05:00.355 --> 00:05:04.284
So you could, for example,

77
00:05:04.284 --> 00:05:09.533
assign this to treesIPicked, okay.

78
00:05:09.533 --> 00:05:11.480
And then when I do it, I click Done.

79
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.350
And if I do trees, there we go.

80
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.008
There they are.

81
00:05:20.008 --> 00:05:23.570
So that's the way that you can,
in this case, this might be useful for

82
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.390
example if you wanted to pick outliers

83
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.760
from a data analysis where you want to
know specifically what points they were.

84
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.800
Notice it's keeping the original
data frame row numbers there so

85
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.400
you could actually refer back
to the data frame itself.

86
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.413
Okay, so just to be clear
about the naming, right, so

87
00:05:44.413 --> 00:05:49.409
if I had named this plot1 for
example instead of plot and I redid it.

88
00:05:56.795 --> 00:06:02.910
My plot doesn't show up and the reason is
because I named my plot plot, not plot1.

89
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.850
So let's cancel that,
we have an error there.

90
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:15.387
So let's say for example if we name
this brush1 instead of brush, okay?

91
00:06:15.387 --> 00:06:20.245
Let's do it, okay.

92
00:06:20.245 --> 00:06:24.610
Now when I run it,
it gives me no output, why?

93
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.081
Because it's looking for
input brush, not input brush1.

94
00:06:28.081 --> 00:06:30.270
And input brush had no input.

95
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.770
Okay, so I hope this gives you some
tools that you can use and build on so

96
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.440
that you can start building
your own Shiny gadgets.

97
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.260
I think this is probably worth learning,
if only for the interactive graphics.

98
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.680
Because interactive graphics are so
useful, and

99
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.310
it's not something that
R has really done well.

100
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.200
Internally and so having this add-on
through RStudio is really a useful thing.

101
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.050
So just for that reason alone, it's
probably worth learning, shiny gadgets and

102
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.360
building that into your workflow.
