00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.420
Okay so here I have the R markdown
document that's associated with the Plotly

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.930
lecture.

3
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.350
I'm going to do library(plotly) of
course after I've installed it, and

4
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.660
then the command is really simple,
plot_ly(mtcars,

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.480
x =,
mtcars is a dataset which is a dataframe.

6
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.600
It's stored as a dataframe.

7
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.900
The x is weight, the y is miles
per gallon, mode is markers.

8
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.160
So, that's just going to create
a scatter plot, so you could copy that

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.410
exact code for any data frame, and
it would give you a scatter plot.

10
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.380
Okay, and you can see your scatter plot in
the RStudio viewer pane, it's interactive.

11
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.520
Right, as you hover over points,
they're showing their x and y values but

12
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.927
there's all this controls up here which
include things like downloading as a PNG,

13
00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:54.000
re-scaling, resetting the axes, changing
what the hover over action does and so on.

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.260
The Publish button works as well,
you can you can publish this to RPubs

15
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.550
just by clicking on this button,
which will create a web graphic for you.

16
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.640
But we'll show you some other ways
to publish it here in a little bit.

17
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.290
Well, one other easy way to publish it,
right here, is when you click on Export.

18
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.540
You can save it as an image,
copy it to Clipboard, but

19
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.120
let's just Save as Web Page to show you
maybe the easiest thing to do, okay?

20
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.730
Then you just need to pick a name,
so let me just call it test.

21
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.290
I already named something test,
so there it goes.

22
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.566
And then it brings up a Web page with
it on, and there's a file test.html

23
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:41.440
on your computer that you could reference.

24
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.630
And you could go in and
actually look at the code.

25
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.010
If you know some JavaScript
you'll understand it totally.

26
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.820
If you don't you should just be able

27
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.672
to clip out the parts that you
need if you wanted to embed it.

28
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.710
So it's super easy to use Plotly.

29
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.290
So your first assignment is to
create a simple scatter plot.

30
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.250
Try it with a different dataset.

31
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.280
Create a webpage.

32
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.750
Create a graphic like a PNG and a PDF.

33
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.890
Maybe publish it to RPubs.

34
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.670
And so try that out and
then we'll move to some other examples.
