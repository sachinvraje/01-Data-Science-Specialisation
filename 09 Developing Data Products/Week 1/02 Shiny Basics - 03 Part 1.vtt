00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.560
Hi and welcome to the lecture on Shiny.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.650
My name is Brian Caffo.

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.600
Shiny is really the cornerstone of this
class because it's the tool that we're

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.210
going to use to develop data products.

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.072
So Shiny is,
let me advance the slide here.

6
00:00:16.072 --> 00:00:19.993
Shiny is a web development framework in R.

7
00:00:19.993 --> 00:00:23.011
And the nice thing is you
only really need to know R.

8
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:29.729
You can use R in the back end, use R
to actually write the user interface.

9
00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:34.810
And you don't need to know the standard
tools like JavaScript, HTML, and so on.

10
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.300
But I'll talk a little
bit more about that.

11
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.570
Let me just talk about Shiny
more broadly first and

12
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.710
then we'll get more into the details.

13
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.550
So broadly, Shiny has been more of
a revolution among those data scientists

14
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.780
that really specialize in R and
focus on developing algorithms,

15
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.930
and analysis, and that component.

16
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.840
Of course, if you work in web development
proper and that's the direction you're

17
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.950
coming to data science from, then you
probably have a different tool set.

18
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.660
You probably wouldn't elect to use
Shiny because you already have so

19
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.720
many tools already at your disposal.

20
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.200
But if you come from this other end,

21
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.080
then Shiny is a great way to
prototype potential data products.

22
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.640
It's a great way to create
small data products

23
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.450
that you would deploy if
you're a smaller organization.

24
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.100
Or if you're a big organization, you might
create something as a prototype, and

25
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.230
then send it off to people with these
other skills that would maybe convert

26
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.260
the R code to some compiled language,

27
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.300
write a super nice JavaScript front-end,
and have a bunch of fancy HTML.

28
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.710
But the nice part about Shiny
is we do everything in R.

29
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.730
We create the GUI in R, the algorithms and
everything else that are powering

30
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.731
it in terms of the data science
part is all written in R and so on.

31
00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:02.227
And your time to create a data
product is completely minimized.

32
00:02:02.227 --> 00:02:06.761
So Shiny is made by R Studio,
it's free, it's just an R package.

33
00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:11.795
What might cost you is you have
to host Shiny on a server, right?

34
00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:13.437
So, it's a web development framework.

35
00:02:13.437 --> 00:02:18.176
You need to actually have a web server
that is not only going to serve up the web

36
00:02:18.176 --> 00:02:22.763
pages but is also going to call R in
the back end to call your algorithms, or

37
00:02:22.763 --> 00:02:24.614
your models, or whatever.

38
00:02:24.614 --> 00:02:30.866
So Shiny itself is free and
open-source, I think it's open-source.

39
00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:36.143
But the hosting might cost you, so
RStudio has this free hosting service,

40
00:02:36.143 --> 00:02:40.090
and that's what we're going to use for
the class.

41
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.650
And you can run your smaller applications
through RStudio's free hosting service.

42
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.730
The other two options you have at your
disposal would be to create your own

43
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.520
server, which you could run off of AWS or
something like that, Amazon AWS.

44
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.080
Or you could do something
like Shiny's paid service.

45
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.790
The other thing you can do is you create
Shiny apps locally, and you test and

46
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.500
debug them locally.

47
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.810
You can give a Shiny app to another person
who uses RStudio, and they can use it in

48
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.920
the web browser just like, I'm sorry,
in RStudio just like you do.

49
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.212
And so, if portability at
that level is what you need,

50
00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:19.570
then you don't actually
need the web server part.

51
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.350
But really, the interesting component
about this is making a web server that

52
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.220
anyone can use that displays
your data analysis,

53
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.740
or your prediction algorithm,
or what have you.

54
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.620
And Shiny gives you a pretty
easy way to do that.

55
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.422
So we'll talk later on
more about the server and

56
00:03:36.422 --> 00:03:41.201
how to use shinyapps.io, which is going to
be the free server we use in this class.

57
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:43.226
And so,
today we're just going to get you started.

58
00:03:43.226 --> 00:03:48.049
We're going to go from zero
up to having a running little

59
00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.812
web server with running R as the back end.

60
00:03:54.065 --> 00:03:57.885
Okay, so some mild prerequisites.

61
00:03:57.885 --> 00:04:03.192
Like I said, you do everything in R,
but I think it would be kind

62
00:04:03.192 --> 00:04:08.213
of hard to do this without
knowledge of a little bit of HTML.

63
00:04:08.213 --> 00:04:12.727
CSS and JavaScript I actually think you
don't need to know any of to do Shiny.

64
00:04:12.727 --> 00:04:18.087
But a little bit of HTML just to
give you some of the basics of what

65
00:04:18.087 --> 00:04:23.768
the commands in R are actually doing,
that would be super useful.

66
00:04:23.768 --> 00:04:25.540
And we're not going to teach that here.

67
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.730
There's a million HTML
tutorials on the Internet.

68
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.400
Just find any, create a basic web page,
learn what some of

69
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.249
the basic commands are and the format
of them, and that's all you need.

70
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.280
Shiny uses this Bootstrap package,
which has no relations to the statistics

71
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.920
bootstrap, which looks nice and
I think it renders well.

72
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.220
It's the folks at Twitter came up with it.

73
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.514
So it creates,
it has a nice set of buttons and

74
00:04:55.514 --> 00:05:00.460
things like that that I think resize
correctly hen you have your page

75
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.179
rendered on a small device like a phone or
on a big screen as well.

76
00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:06.269
So they've thought through that.

77
00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:10.607
I think Bootstrap, if you don't know
a lot about that kind of web development,

78
00:05:10.607 --> 00:05:13.020
then just stick with the Bootstrap themes.

79
00:05:15.134 --> 00:05:19.475
And so again, I just give you some more
tutorials if you want to learn about

80
00:05:19.475 --> 00:05:24.100
the three core components of at least
the front end of the kind of applications

81
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.893
we're going to be developing.

82
00:05:25.893 --> 00:05:28.283
HTML, CSS will give you the style, and

83
00:05:28.283 --> 00:05:32.010
JavaScript is what gives
you all the interactivity.

84
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.040
I'm giving you some tutorials there.

85
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.671
Most importantly, do some of the HTML one.

86
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:44.359
Okay, so getting started, you got to
install Shiny, install.packages("shiny").

87
00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:48.037
And then whenever you get it working with
Shiny, you gotta make sure it's loaded up,

88
00:05:48.037 --> 00:05:49.070
so library(shiny).

89
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.842
And then there's a,
before you even start this,

90
00:05:51.842 --> 00:05:55.481
you might even consider the official
Shiny tutorial at RStudio.

91
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:58.899
And mostly this lecture is
walking through that tutorial.

92
00:06:02.321 --> 00:06:06.155
Okay, so I'm going to start going through
some code demonstrations here in a minute,

93
00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:08.890
but let me just go through
the basics really quick.

94
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.850
What you need for
a Shiny project is you need ui.R,

95
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.890
a file called ui.R, and
a file called server.R.

96
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.820
So ui gives you the user interface, and

97
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.390
it'll determine how your app looks and
server.R will control what your app does.

98
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.570
Okay?

99
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.890
Now I'm going to switch over and

100
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:35.190
start doing some code demonstrations and
so stay tuned
