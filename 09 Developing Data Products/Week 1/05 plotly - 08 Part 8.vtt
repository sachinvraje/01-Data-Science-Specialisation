00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.790
So the last thing I want to do is just
show you how to post a plotly directly.

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.500
So I created in the last video this GG
plot example, and here it is over here.

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.300
It was labeled GG so

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.930
if I type GG in the R prompt, it's
going to bring it up in the viewer pane.

5
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.600
But if I typed plotly_POST GG,

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.270
then what it'll do is actually
post it to the plotly website.

7
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.820
And at the plotly website
there's all different things

8
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.820
that you can do,
this is the sort of output but

9
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.250
if you click on edit here,
it will give you all different tools to

10
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.840
edit it with their web base
graphical user interface.

11
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.590
So, I think plotly,
it's fairly self-explanatory, but

12
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.040
they also have videos on how to use it and
a lot of tutorials and things like that.

13
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.560
So try exporting a graphic to plotly and
working with their user interface for

14
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.340
playing around with it, changing the axes,
changing the variable names and so on.

15
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.970
The last thing I want to say before
I finish is that, in order for

16
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.700
this to kind of work seamlessly, you have
to set these two environment variables.

17
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.930
If you just look at Google

18
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.600
search on post to plotly from R,
it will direct you to this page,

19
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.700
you basically have to set a plotly
username and plotly API key.

20
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.520
To get your API key, you just go in
plotly to settings and there's and

21
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.990
just copy and paste it from there, okay.

22
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.180
And so, then when you set these two
environment variables especially

23
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.220
if you put those in your .Rprofile so
that they're set every time you start

24
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.370
up R then you won't be prompted for
your credentials.
