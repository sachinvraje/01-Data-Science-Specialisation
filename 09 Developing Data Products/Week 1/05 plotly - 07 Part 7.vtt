00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.320
So if you're a fan of ggplot,

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.530
then I think you'll be happy about
this code from the Plotly website.

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.740
So here, I'm just going to
show it to you really quick.

4
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.950
I'm creating a ggplot from
the diamond data set.

5
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:20.690
So if I show it to you here, you see it's
just diamond carat versus price, okay?

6
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.250
Now, what I wanted to show you is that
Plotly has this command, ggplotly, where

7
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.440
you can just immediately convert a ggplot
into a Plotly interactive HTML graphic.

8
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.020
So up here in the top window, it's a R
graphic in the RStudio viewer pane.

9
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.657
I'm sorry in the RStudio plotting pane and

10
00:00:43.657 --> 00:00:48.060
then in the bottom one it's an HTML
graphic in the RStudio viewer pane.

11
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.840
So the bottom one's just displaying it
as you would see it in a web browser
