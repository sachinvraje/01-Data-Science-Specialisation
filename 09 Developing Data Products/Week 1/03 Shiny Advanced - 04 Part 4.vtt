00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.220
So, let's just go over now a couple of
different ways we can tweak the UI for

2
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.930
shiny.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.700
You already have kind of a default
theme with the side bar panel.

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.150
Let's go over one with the tab and
I think once you've gone through these two

5
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.620
versions, you'll kind of
notice the patterns and

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.170
you'll be able to tweak it with
a lot of different settings.

7
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.900
Also we'll talk a little bit at
the end about how you can actually do

8
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.730
Shiny with a custom HTML function.

9
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.550
Okay, so letâ€™s just go through this
Advanced UI example and at the end,

10
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.949
we'll have some final discussion.

11
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.820
Okay, so I copied the code from
the R marked down document.

12
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.260
Hopefully the first couple of lines
are very familiar to you at this point.

13
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.110
We're still going to have a side bar
layout and you can do tabs within

14
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.000
a single panel,
just with no side bar, just the tabs.

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.530
You just need to change the layout.

16
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.080
So you can have a different layout with
tabs but we're going to have a side bar

17
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.610
layout where the side bar is
going to have the inputs and

18
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.340
then the main panel is going to have tabs.

19
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.146
But you can also just have one big panel,
not with a side bar, and

20
00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:16.577
have it have tabs.

21
00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:23.427
Or as we'll talk about later you can
tweak the UI infinitely with custom HTML.

22
00:01:23.427 --> 00:01:29.020
Okay so our sidebar panel is just
going to have three text input boxes and

23
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.718
the labels for those inputs are going to
be box one, box two, box three.

24
00:01:34.718 --> 00:01:38.576
The prompts to the user are going to be
enter tab one text, enter tab two text,

25
00:01:38.576 --> 00:01:40.600
enter tab three text.

26
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.528
And then the starting value is
going to be Tab 1, Tab 2 and Tab 3.

27
00:01:45.528 --> 00:01:50.070
Okay now in the main panel we are going
to have a subset of the main panel,

28
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.780
called a tabset panel.

29
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.739
And this is kind of this nested
user-interface-structured

30
00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:00.890
that shiny allows with
it's with a syntax here.

31
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.538
So we have a mainPanel, and then we have
a tabsetPanel inside that function, okay?

32
00:02:07.538 --> 00:02:11.830
And type = "tabs", and
then we have three tabPanels.

33
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.760
And these tabPanel statements
are working just like our mainPanel and

34
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.160
sidebarPanel functions.

35
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.490
They work in the same way.

36
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.410
We just have them strung out into one line
because they're very short in this case.

37
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.500
So our tabPanel is going to
have a label that says Tab 1.

38
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.110
It's going to have, basically,
a character term, to go down a line.

39
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.390
And then it's going to have textOutput,
out1.

40
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.220
So it's going to be looking for out1 from
the sever.R function, textOutput, out2.

41
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.910
Again, it's going to be looking for

42
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.850
something labeled output$out2 from
the server, Server.ourfile and so on.

43
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.432
Okay, so now let's look at our server.

44
00:02:48.432 --> 00:02:52.794
Okay, it's going to be a very simple one,
shinyServer(function(input, output) so

45
00:02:52.794 --> 00:02:54.500
this should all be very familiar.

46
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.910
Okay, and there's our output$out1 and
it's going to be renderText.

47
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.230
Okay, because remember what we want to do
in this piece when we go back to the UI we

48
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.440
want to display the text, and
we're just going to do nothing.

49
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.850
We' re just going to Spit back out
whatever the person entered in box1,

50
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.780
box2 and box3.

51
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.083
So let's go ahead and run that.

52
00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:21.040
All right, so here's our three
text boxes for entering text.

53
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.240
And here's our three tabs.

54
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.750
So let's put it in tab two.

55
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.080
So if I just put it enter new text, okay,
and I go to Tab 2, it says enter new text.

56
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.508
Okay so that's just a nice
little tweak of the UI and

57
00:03:39.508 --> 00:03:44.852
hopefully as you're doing it, you're
starting to get a sense of the syntax and

58
00:03:44.852 --> 00:03:47.111
how it works a little bit better.

59
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:51.380
Make sure when you're doing all your UI
tweaks in everything that you don't have

60
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.703
any errors in the r code, or
studio will give you a little X's in

61
00:03:54.703 --> 00:03:58.000
the code if you've forgotten to come or
something like that.

62
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.858
And I think that's probably the biggest
challenge with the UI programming, and

63
00:04:02.858 --> 00:04:06.217
R is making sure you've closed
all your parenthesis and

64
00:04:06.217 --> 00:04:09.520
added all the necessary commas and
that sort of thing.

65
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.850
And I think proper indentation and
doing your

66
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.340
coding in a nice environment like RStudio
will really help that tremendously.

67
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.270
Okay, so your homework now is to develop
a tabbed user interface for Shiny

68
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.320
and just next we're going to go through
just some of our final comments on Shiny.
