00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.060
All right, so let's create a map
with some nice hover-over effects.

2
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.250
So the first thing I'm going to do
is these two statements right here.

3
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.090
There's a little bit of
code in this example.

4
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.480
So I'm not going to go over
every single little detail.

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.610
But let me just create this dataset,
and then show it to you.

6
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.650
Let me just get the first couple rows.

7
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.760
Okay, so notice there's 50 of them, so
you can see at the end there's 50 of them,

8
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.910
so for
each state we have its abbreviation.

9
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.690
Okay, so take Alabama for example,

10
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.376
we have it's population in millions,
and then we have some hover-over text.

11
00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:47.250
So this hover-over text is going to
be the state abbreviation,

12
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.980
Alabama, then a line break,
then population 3,615,000.

13
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.080
This is population in 1975.

14
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.269
Okay.

15
00:00:59.557 --> 00:01:03.480
The borders,
this is just going to be an option.

16
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.837
This is kind of unnecessary, but
we're just going to make those red.

17
00:01:07.837 --> 00:01:09.514
Okay.

18
00:01:09.514 --> 00:01:12.610
And then map options, again,
it's going to be a list.

19
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.310
The scope,
we want the USA to be the scope.

20
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.000
And just play around with these options.

21
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.527
I think, you'll have to just, if you want
to dramatically change this map, do it for

22
00:01:29.527 --> 00:01:34.152
a different area or country, you'll have
to flub your way through it a little bit,

23
00:01:34.152 --> 00:01:36.357
but I think a lot of it is quite obvious.

24
00:01:36.357 --> 00:01:40.829
Like showlakes = TRUE,
just means you're going to show the lakes.

25
00:01:43.092 --> 00:01:47.690
Lake color white, so in this case
I think we changed the lake color

26
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.140
to white just because the color
coding we're using is blue for

27
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.130
population, so we didn't want the lakes to

28
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.190
be blended in with the states
with the same color of blue.

29
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.792
Okay, so then plot_ly,
again, is the command,

30
00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:08.980
the state_pop is just the data frame,
okay.

31
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.000
z is the population, text is equals hover,

32
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.280
that's just means we want
some hover-over text.

33
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.030
The locations are given
by the column name State,

34
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.725
type is choropleth,
location mode is USA-states.

35
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.520
Color is we're going to
color-code by the population.

36
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.427
The colors, this is just,
the palette itâ€™s using in this case is

37
00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:40.636
just the blues which is just
a continuous shade of blue.

38
00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:46.018
And then this gives how it's
going to draw the markers,

39
00:02:46.018 --> 00:02:48.898
in this case on the borders.

40
00:02:48.898 --> 00:02:54.432
And this is then passed, the output
of plot_ly is then passed to layout,

41
00:02:54.432 --> 00:03:01.300
which also then gives it not only a title,
but then it brings in these map options.

42
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.240
Okay?

43
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.490
So, let's go ahead and run that.

44
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.150
And for me, it wouldn't, I guess, maybe,
this is just too complicated, but

45
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.700
it wouldn't display in the viewer for me.

46
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.790
So I'm going to click Save as Web Page,
and just

47
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.150
overwrite the kind of template web page
that I've been using for this example.

48
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.730
And there it is in my browser window.

49
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.239
So, now what I hover over a state,
it's got the state's population.

50
00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.930
So we could go to Alabama, for example.

51
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.407
You can see that's the exact text
we wanted right there, Alabama.

52
00:03:41.407 --> 00:03:42.791
Okay?

53
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:46.110
All right, so try and create a map.

54
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.500
First thing I would say is take this
data frame that we're looking at,

55
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.130
it's got other columns in it,
not just population, and try and

56
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.780
create some other maps and
output them to web pages.

57
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.209
And I think as you go through it,
you'll get a better feel for the options.

58
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.580
So as a start, just recreate this map, and

59
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.170
then try to recreate one with
some of the different variables.

60
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.380
Try to have the color
mean a different thing.

61
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.180
And I think you'll find this is a pretty
handy way to create interactive maps
