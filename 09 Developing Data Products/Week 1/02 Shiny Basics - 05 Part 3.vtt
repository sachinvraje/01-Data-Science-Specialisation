00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.130
So remember that when we're
building our Shiny app,

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.880
at least when we're using
the default type work flow,

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.860
we're going to be using R
to put in our HTML element.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.030
So all of the really standard
HTML tags exist in Shiny.

5
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.510
So you have all of the heading tags,
oops, let me get my pen, pen here.

6
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:30.680
We have all of our heading tags,
h1 through h6, the little p hyper-refs,

7
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.010
and divs, and spans, and
all the most common ones.

8
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.650
So if you do ?builder, it'll give just
a complete list of all the various

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.980
HTML tags you can use.

10
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.280
Later on, we'll actually show you
how you can use your own HTML file,

11
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.610
so that you can use whatever you
want to build your Shiny app.

12
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.780
And you can make your page
as elaborate as you'd like.

13
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.659
For right now, we're just going to
be using the built-in functions.

14
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.310
So in the next code example,

15
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.950
I'm just going to show you the different
headings and things like that.

16
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.710
So we're just going to show
you the different kinds of

17
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.950
HTML tags that we can use or
just a subset of them.

18
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.359
So mostly, I'm going to go over this one,
to formatting tags, so

19
00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:20.503
here in my UI.R function, here,
I've just put a couple of the headings,

20
00:01:20.503 --> 00:01:25.178
I've copied this code from the next
slide on the slide deck, okay?

21
00:01:25.178 --> 00:01:29.780
So here, we have h1, h2, h3,
these all occur in the sidebar layout.

22
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.850
I give some emphasized text right here,
and here,

23
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.770
I give some code text,
which will put it in a mono space format.

24
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.470
You want to do that when you're displaying
code, you always want to display,

25
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.160
just like when you're editing code,
you always want it in a mono space format.

26
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.970
Okay, so you want to run the app now,
and there,

27
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.500
you can see it,
the different heading values and so

28
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.330
on, okay, the main panel,
the code listed in some mono space format.

29
00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.303
So you can look at all these
things just by doing ?builder.

30
00:02:01.303 --> 00:02:05.000
Okay, and there we go.

31
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.860
These are all the different
html tags that you have.

32
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.870
Another thing you can do,
let me run the app again, so it's running.

33
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.080
Okay, if you just click
on Open in Browser,

34
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.960
it will open it up in a web browser, okay?

35
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.704
And here is your html tags,
but I just want to do Ctrl+U.

36
00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:28.053
So that you can actually just see the R
code then effectively creates a webpage,

37
00:02:28.053 --> 00:02:33.197
and here, you can actually see
the webpage that it's created.

38
00:02:33.197 --> 00:02:36.629
You can see the JavaScript
libraries that it loads up and so

39
00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.460
on to actually run Shiny.

40
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.550
But more importantly, so I probably
wouldn't worry too much about the head,

41
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.220
unless you're familiar with
a little bit of JavaScript.

42
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.270
Most of what this stuff is,

43
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.670
is style sheets in the Twitter
bootstrap stuff, which is the style,

44
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.640
the formatting for all the buttons and
style and everything that Shiny uses.

45
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.040
But also, it has some of the input,
output things that Shiny requires as well.

46
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.010
But most of the stuff we're displaying
is here in this part in the body and

47
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.120
then you can just see how
it uses the function and

48
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.360
how it creates the HTML commands, okay?

49
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.530
So it's just translating your UI.R
into this function right here.

50
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.700
And this is a useful thing to do,

51
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.830
especially when you start to do things
like named buttons and things like that.

52
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.471
You can see how it actually
goes into the HTML.

53
00:03:27.471 --> 00:03:31.432
And in fact, if you're comfortable with
Shiny, but not very comfortable with HTML,

54
00:03:31.432 --> 00:03:33.563
this will be a way to get
used to coding in HTML.

55
00:03:33.563 --> 00:03:37.478
because I think, at some point, if you're
going to want to develop fancy enough

56
00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:42.034
webpages that call R on the back end, even
if you're using Shiny as the mechanism for

57
00:03:42.034 --> 00:03:46.013
doing that, you probably are going to
want to be developing your own webpages

58
00:03:46.013 --> 00:03:47.258
and not using a UI.R.

59
00:03:47.258 --> 00:03:48.297
Okay, so hopefully,

60
00:03:48.297 --> 00:03:52.080
this gets you a little bit of familiarity
with using some of the HTML tags.

61
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.604
Play around with them, and try and
design just a simple webpage with no

62
00:03:56.604 --> 00:04:00.681
interactivity, just a webpage
that shows what you like on it.

63
00:04:00.681 --> 00:04:03.973
Okay, and then next, we're going to start
working towards adding some buttons and

64
00:04:03.973 --> 00:04:06.547
some sliders and some graphs, and
calling R in the back end, and

65
00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:08.760
some of the important things
that Shiny will do for us.
