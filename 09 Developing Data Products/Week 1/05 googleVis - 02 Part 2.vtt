00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.408
So, googleVis is a pretty amazing package.

2
00:00:03.408 --> 00:00:10.140
It gives you access to most of Google's
visualization tools that they have.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.930
So, motion charts, we already covered.

4
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.380
Interactive maps,
we'll go over in a minute.

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.640
Interactive tables,
line charts, bar charts.

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.710
They even have things that'll make like
a little speedometer based on a graph or

7
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.420
metric that you want, and so on.

8
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.270
So, just go to the documentation for
googleVis, and

9
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.830
it'll show you a bunch of them.

10
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.290
It's really well documented.

11
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.110
They both have a vignette and,
of course, the packaged documentation.

12
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.390
So, interactive graphs
are a great way to use googleVis,

13
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.410
because the mapping stuff is hard, but
Google's done a lot of it for you already.

14
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.350
So, if you want to create JavaScript
maps that have little pop ups over

15
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.670
the countries that you specify, and

16
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.601
have it nice so that you can embed it in
a webpage or a Slidify presentation, or

17
00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:57.160
a presentation or a document or
so on, it's not so bad.

18
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.798
So, here's an example right here.

19
00:00:58.798 --> 00:01:02.366
You can see in our R
markdown presentation,

20
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:06.190
it actually does the interactivity.

21
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.890
Okay.

22
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.060
And, of course, you can zoom in if
you want, and do things like this, so

23
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.390
that this is just specifying the options.

24
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.860
Now, while we're on the topic of options,
there's a million different options.

25
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.810
I give you the link down here to
show you where the options occur,

26
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.390
what page, that you can pass as
arguments to your googleVis chart.

27
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.410
So, how that works is just as
an options command, as a list.

28
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.580
You need to name them right,
and give them the right value.

29
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:41.260
And then, you need to use this syntax
that is, I guess it's just JSON syntax.

30
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.390
But as long as you can, but
you probably don't need to know any JSON.

31
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.800
You just actually need to kind of look
at it once or twice, and get used to it.

32
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.556
And then I think it should be no problem.

33
00:01:54.556 --> 00:01:58.940
Okay, so here's an example
of just doing a line chart.

34
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.520
And the last thing I want to

35
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.100
talk about is the idea that you can
just merge multiple plots together.

36
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.510
So, that's just using gvisMerge.

37
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.970
And then, here is an example.

38
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.020
After you've done it, here's
the left-hand plot, you see our plot.

39
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.090
You see a table.

40
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.590
And you see a chart, all together.

41
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.580
Okay?

42
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.380
So, we'll go through a code
example of all these things.

43
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.610
Here is how you can just see,
of course, the code,

44
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.950
we already talked about that,
just print, will print out the code.

45
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.760
And then, like we mentioned, you can embed
the results in a markdown document just

46
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.280
like we've done in this exact document.

47
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.980
An important thing,
I think, there's two things.

48
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.960
One is make sure you have the most
current versions of everything.

49
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.230
R, Slidify, data, or
whatever it is you're using.

50
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.954
And then, the second important thing is
results equals as is in the chunk options.

51
00:02:52.954 --> 00:02:56.480
That, I haven't had it,
it won't work otherwise.

52
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.760
But then,
you can get it to work after that.

53
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.730
And I've done this a bunch of times
between the last iteration of this class

54
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.035
and the next one, and I've seen that
this is a pretty finicky process.

55
00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:13.250
And you tend to have to tweak
around with it a little bit,

56
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.910
but you usually get it in the end.

57
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.290
Often, I have to reinstall things.

58
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.470
Make sure you clear the knitr cache,
and that sort of thing.

59
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.600
And eventually you'll get it.

60
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.140
But it seems to be a little bit
of a persnickety thing, but

61
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.700
once you get it once then it'll be fine.

62
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.130
Okay, so let's start going
through some of the code,

63
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.560
and generate some interesting graphs.

64
00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:38.870
Okay, so let's, as a first thing,
generate this chart.

65
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.840
So, before I show you anything,

66
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.640
let me just show you the data
frame that we're going to display.

67
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.290
Okay, so there's the country names.

68
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.320
Okay?

69
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.170
It has a value that's
going to go into the pop-up.

70
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.590
And then, online true or false.

71
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.570
I think, at this point, we're

72
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.770
just going to use the country and
the profit variable.

73
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.480
Okay, now when we look up at our code,

74
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.010
we see gvisGeoChart, okay, Exports,
okay, that's just the data frame.

75
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.160
locationvar = "Country".

76
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.830
That's just the variable name, country.

77
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.090
It's going to look for a text field
that has the country label names.

78
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.690
And the color variable is profit.

79
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.660
Okay, and then the options,
this is just formatting options.

80
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.270
Okay, so let's do that.

81
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.730
And then, I'm going to once
again plot it so we can see it.

82
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.030
Okay, and it brings up a webpage.

83
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.100
There you go.
Look at that, pretty cool.

84
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.480
That is pretty fancy for almost no effort.

85
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:48.010
Okay, now let's go down to
specifying your region.

86
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.176
Okay, gvisGeoChart, again.

87
00:04:51.176 --> 00:04:54.572
And then here,
we specify region equals 150.

88
00:04:54.572 --> 00:04:57.350
That's going to zoom in on that region.

89
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.467
Let's try it.

90
00:04:59.467 --> 00:05:04.339
G2, okay, now if we do plot G2,

91
00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:09.727
bam, right there, Western Europe.

92
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:14.657
Okay, looks good.

93
00:05:14.657 --> 00:05:20.540
Okay, so now, let's just go through some
of our options, and see how they're set.

94
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.500
Again, this, we're just going to
create a very simple line chart.

95
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.920
Okay, let's create this
data frame right here.

96
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.380
There it is.

97
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.200
Okay, there's our data frame.

98
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.600
Maybe, U.S., Great Britain, Brazil.

99
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.640
Value one, value two.

100
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.020
Okay, now let's create our gVis chart.

101
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.910
We'll call it Line with a capital L.

102
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.270
And then, if we do plot line,
now it brings it up.

103
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.600
Hello world, it says.

104
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.940
And then it's just got this simple plot.

105
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.940
So, look at the way we're
setting the options there, and

106
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.490
connect them back to the plot.

107
00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.970
I think it'll be pretty clear to you
the JavaScript notation is a little bit

108
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.960
annoying if you're not used to it,
but you're really just passing

109
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.500
the options exactly as Google Charts
wants you to pass them, right?

110
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.130
There's no translation going through.

111
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.450
So, it's good to know because,
at some point,

112
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.300
you might want to create a Google Chart
using Google Docs or something like that,

113
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.820
and have the options set in the same
way that you have them set here.

114
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.760
Okay, last thing we want to do is
create multiple plots together, okay?

115
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.210
Here, we've created our geo
chart just like we did before.

116
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.450
Here's a table.

117
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.010
So, this is just an example
of creating a table.

118
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:42.600
But again, this is just taking our
data as is, and creating a table.

119
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.960
The motion chart that we have from before.

120
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.550
Okay, and
then what I'm going to do is merge

121
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.728
the GeoChart and
the gvisTable in one plot.

122
00:06:58.728 --> 00:07:01.890
And then, horizontal=FALSE means
it's going to stack them up one

123
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.210
on top of each other.

124
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.185
And then, I'm going to merge this
new plot and the other one together.

125
00:07:07.185 --> 00:07:11.420
Horizontal=TRUE side by side, okay?

126
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.375
Now, if I print, I'm sorry plot DTM.

127
00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:18.550
There, it's going to bring it up.

128
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.790
And there you see.

129
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.470
Now, it looks pretty nice, right?

130
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.060
It's got the plot up here, right?

131
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:31.470
It's got the print out of the data
frame there, and an interactive table.

132
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.210
And it's got the motion chart over here.

133
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:35.380
Okay.
So, that's pretty.

134
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.590
And you can see some of the options.

135
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.010
You can set the background color and
that sort of thing.

136
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:45.080
But this is a pretty nifty little
plot with relatively little code,

137
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.330
and it's really just because
Google's plotting library's

138
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.380
going to be doing all the hard
work in the back end.

139
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.390
And that's why this takes so little code.

140
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.790
So, play around with this,
create some Google Charts.

141
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.545
I think you'll be happy at how
easy it makes Google Charts.

142
00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:01.980
And try a couple of these for homework.
