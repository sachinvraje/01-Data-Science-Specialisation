00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.710
So hi, My name is Brian Caffo,

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.740
and I am going to talk about
Shiny Gadgets during this lecture.

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.710
I'd like to thank Shaun Cross,

4
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.080
who works with the Data Science Lab here
with us, for preparing these slides.

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.180
So, we used to have, we used to
cover a topic called Manipulate.

6
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.780
And manipulate was a little r
package that was produced and

7
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.150
created by our studio for
use in our studio.

8
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.380
For simple interactive and
easy data analysis.

9
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.214
So if you needed some interactive plots or
something like that in the data analysis,

10
00:00:37.214 --> 00:00:39.350
Manipulate was a nice way to do it.

11
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.060
However, they seem to have stopped
developing on Manipulate and

12
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.170
I think I know why.

13
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.320
Because the Shiny environment is just
kind of a better way to do it and

14
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.230
with shiny gadgets,
you can now do the same thing.

15
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.690
Within the the RStudio program and

16
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.400
it basically serves the same function
of what Manipulate used to do.

17
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.120
So, just to discuss.

18
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.270
The Shiny Gadgets is going to provide a
way to just use Shiny's interactivity, but

19
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.440
in data analysis.

20
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.076
So, it's going to be an easier and
quicker way to use it and

21
00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:17.960
it's not going to be
the full web development.

22
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.650
We're going to be using Shiny, for

23
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.220
where we wanted kind of a forward facing
app that other people are going to use.

24
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.600
Shiny Gadgets is more for us or maybe for

25
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.090
a handful of other people that
are working for us on data analysis.

26
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.820
And then, since we are going to
display the app in the small screen

27
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.498
in our studio program.

28
00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:42.050
We're going to use the mini
UI package which gives us,

29
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.845
which helps us create the interfaces for
the smaller screen.

30
00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:49.200
Okay, so I'm going to read
a little bit of this slide,

31
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.520
just because I think
this is the core here.

32
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.620
So, a shiny gadget is a function
that launches a small single page

33
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.850
shiny application In
the RStudio viewer pane.

34
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.900
And again, since they're going to be
viewed in the RStudio viewer pane,

35
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.490
the miniUI package comes in handy.

36
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.310
So what we're going to do next is, we're
going to create a simple shiny gadget.

37
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.721
And then, we're going to reduce it down
to the simplest possible program and

38
00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:17.570
go to the element.

39
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.459
So I'm to switch over and
do a code demonstration now.

40
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.040
Okay, so here I am in our studio.

41
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.480
I've got the simplest
possible shiny gadget that I

42
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.910
grabbed from the code from the slides.

43
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.770
Okay, the first two things that I'm
going to do is make sure Shiny and

44
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.180
mini UI are loaded.

45
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.960
And if you don't have them,
just make sure to do install.packages.

46
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.400
Or you can of course,

47
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.960
add in the patches by clicking your way
to victory up here with the toolbars.

48
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.240
But just do install.packages.

49
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.870
It works for my version of R.

50
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.270
Right now, my version is 3.2.1,
so it's a little bit old.

51
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.700
But I think if you have a really old
version of r, you probably want to update.

52
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.720
Since this is some relatively
new developments from RStudio,

53
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.540
so if you're running a very old
version of R, then just update.

54
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.490
It's pretty easy to do, so
I would go ahead and do that.

55
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.650
So your gadget is going to be a function.

56
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.480
My first gadget here is the R function,
okay.

57
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.870
No arguments right now,
we'll get to that later and

58
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.260
just like a Shiny app, it's got a user
interface and a server function.

59
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.150
So, my UI here says mini page and
that's just the layout we're going to use.

60
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.618
That's from the mini UI library and

61
00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:44.290
so, we have the simplest
possible page that we can create.

62
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.530
All it's going to have is a title bar,
so the command for

63
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.540
adding a title bar element
is gadgetTitleBar.

64
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.050
And let's just call it My First Gadget,
okay now my server is also a function.

65
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.614
And it takes some argument Input,
output and session, okay.

66
00:04:02.614 --> 00:04:05.699
And then,all our server
is going to do now is,

67
00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:10.910
it's just going to check the input for
this variable done, okay.

68
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.929
And use the observe event function for
when that's true to stop the app, okay?

69
00:04:17.929 --> 00:04:22.380
So just, I know this syntax,
Select Shiny is a little bit weird and

70
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.730
a little bit unusual relative to
how we normally program an hour.

71
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.600
But I think once you get used to it,

72
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.480
the one thing you want to make sure
is all the rules about reactivity.

73
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.310
And things like that are going to
carry over from Shiny into our

74
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.070
Shiny gadgets, okay.

75
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.740
And then, we have our function that
is runGadget ui and server, okay.

76
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.120
So, everything is now
contained in this function.

77
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.175
So, I need to source it.

78
00:04:47.175 --> 00:04:53.580
[NOISE] There we go and now, let's run it,

79
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.975
myFirstGadget Bam, okay?

80
00:04:57.975 --> 00:05:01.130
Now, see it says listening.

81
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.260
So, it's created a little web server.

82
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.100
And now,
our studio is rendering the web page and

83
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.420
listening to the server right
here in this viewer pane.

84
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.230
And it just says My First Gadget, so
it doesn't do much right now, but

85
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.470
if you click done, it just brings
you back to the RPrompt there.

86
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.350
Okay, so this is important first step
to getting used to Shiny Gadgets but

87
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.190
as you've already taken and
done some Shiny.

88
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.360
I think a lot of the more complex
ideas and Shiny like activities and

89
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.520
things like that will come very naturally.

90
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.920
As we move further along in Shiny Gadgets.

91
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.630
So what I like everybody do now is,

92
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.800
if we're going on to the next video, just
grab this code from the selection notes.

93
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.990
Run it once, and then we'll move
on to some more complex things.
