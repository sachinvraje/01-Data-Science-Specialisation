1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.910
Okay, so let's go ahead and
create our first app.

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.020
So you need a relatively
recent version of RStudio or

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.830
I think you should have a relatively
recent version of RStudio

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.820
just because of some
things like the filing.

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.300
So I think probably the easiest
way to start is Alt+F or File,

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.570
and then New File, and
then Shiny Web App, okay?

7
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.650
So when you click that, it brings up
a thing, name it whatever you want, so

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.580
you could name it myApp or
something like that.

9
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.800
And then you can choose whether to have
the files in a single file which we did

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.180
not talk about or in two files.

11
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.840
A ui.R and a server.R file,
which we did talk, and we will talk about.

12
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.120
I'm going to recommend doing it this way,
just because I always like to have,

13
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.420
I'd rather have many small files than one
big file with lots of functions in it.

14
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.050
So I always tend to work that way,
but also note that it's not

15
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.750
the files that it needs,
it's not ui.R and server.R that it needs.

16
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.858
It's the specific named
functions in the ur.R and

17
00:01:04.858 --> 00:01:08.210
server.R files that it actually needs.

18
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.860
And you'll see those in a second.

19
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.660
I'm not going to create this
because I've already done it.

20
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.760
So when it creates it,
it creates the directory and

21
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.020
then it creates the two files.

22
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.150
You can see here's my ur.R and server.R.

23
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.743
No I took the Shiny pre-populated ui.R and

24
00:01:25.743 --> 00:01:31.980
server.R files and then just pasted in
the versions from the lecture notes, okay?

25
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.798
So the key thing in the ui.r is you
need to have this ShinyUI function,

26
00:01:36.798 --> 00:01:42.681
well you need to have library(shiny), but
you need to have this ShinyUI function,

27
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:46.205
that's going to control
the user interface, okay?

28
00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:49.630
And then in the server.R you need
something called shinyServer.

29
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.040
In this case our server is not
going to do anything, okay?

30
00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.150
Now let's look at the shinyUI function
a little bit In a little bit more detail.

31
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.920
Let's put a little space right there.

32
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.800
Okay, so we have fluid page,
which just describes the page

33
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.430
type that we're going to use
to create our user interface.

34
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.790
So this is kind of a default and

35
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.550
I would just suggest that you use it
until you learn a little bit more.

36
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.240
So titlePanel,
you'll see where this comes up.

37
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.460
And it's going to say Data science FTW!.

38
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.620
So this is just going to set
one of the GUI elements, and

39
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.430
in this case just a title.

40
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.980
And then by default in the fluidPage
it's got a main panel and a side panel.

41
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.920
So here we're going to give
it the sidebar layout.

42
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.440
Okay, so it's just saying what's
going to occur in the sidebar.

43
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.361
So the sidebarPanel is going to tell us
what's going to occur in the sidebar.

44
00:02:46.361 --> 00:02:53.860
And h3, so h3 is going to give
you the html third level index.

45
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.490
So if you've learned a little bit of html,
just h3 is just going to

46
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.450
be smaller text than h2, which is just
going to be smaller text than h1.

47
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.420
So it's the heading level.

48
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.880
So third level heading.

49
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.420
And it's just going to say slidebar Text
and this is where the slidebar goes.

50
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.480
So and main panel is just
going to be that center panel and

51
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.610
we're also going to do that in h3 and
it's going to say main panel text, okay.

52
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.500
So sidebar layout is just going to say in
my fluid page I'm going to have a sidebar

53
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.030
type layout with a part on the left that's
going to give us navigation and things

54
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.630
like that and a main panel on the right,
that's going to have the main content.

55
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.508
Okay, and so
just keep track of these three phrases,

56
00:03:32.508 --> 00:03:36.320
titlePanel("Data science FTW!), sidebar,

57
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.720
Sidebar Text Main panel, main panel text,
and you'll see where it puts them all.

58
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.340
So, there's two ways to run it.

59
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.810
The easiest way, if you have
a relatively recent version of RStudio,

60
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.564
you can just click run app.

61
00:03:48.564 --> 00:03:51.689
And I want to save them.

62
00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.910
I should have clicked
always save before build.

63
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.588
And there you go, there you see
your elements, Data science FTW!

64
00:03:56.588 --> 00:04:04.090
In the title, this is in the sidebar and
this is in the main panel, okay?

65
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.750
So those are our three elements in our
fluid page with the sidebar layout.

66
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.530
Let me just show you
the other way to run it.

67
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.970
We gotta switch to the directory
where our ui.R and server.R are at.

68
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.800
So you can just do Alt + S + W + Return.

69
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.770
Okay, so that's Alt + S + W + Return,
or click on Session,

70
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.190
click on Set Working Directory and
click on To Source File Location, okay?

71
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.330
And then you just type runApp().

72
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.810
There you go.

73
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.465
Okay?

74
00:04:40.465 --> 00:04:47.100
When you type in runApp, you can put
in here the path to the app, okay?

75
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.600
So, if you'd rather do it that way,
you can put in the path to the app, and

76
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.790
then you don't even have
to be in the directory.

77
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.980
Notice it's running it in RStudio.

78
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.850
This is RStudio bringing up the HTML page.

79
00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.921
Let me show you one other thing.

80
00:04:58.921 --> 00:05:02.291
So here it is running,
but if you look down here,

81
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:05.340
it says listening on and it gives a URL.

82
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.900
So basically what it's doing,

83
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.940
Shiny is just creating a little
web server on your computer and

84
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.550
that web page is just RStudio's
browser accessing that web server.

85
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.050
So when you run and debug things locally.

86
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.480
It's just going to create a little
web server for you running locally.

87
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.760
And that RStudio is going
to be able to access.

88
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.830
And at some point we want to push it up
in to the Internet so that it's running

89
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.240
on a public web server so that anyone can
access it, not just you on your computer.

90
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.580
But this would also show you how
the lowest and kind of easiest form of

91
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.912
delivering a Shiny app to another RStudio
user is to just give them the ur.R,

92
00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:51.000
server.r functions and all the other
functions that they need to run it.

93
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.850
Just give it to them and
they can run it just like you can, but

94
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.280
that's not what we want in the long run.

95
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.150
We want it up and running on a webpage.

96
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.040
So we've done the first step and
let's keep moving and

97
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.739
see if we can populate and
make our app a little bit more useful.
