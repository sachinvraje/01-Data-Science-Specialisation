Hi, my name is Bryan Caffo and welcome
to the Developing Data Products course.

2
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.890
This course is about building tools for

3
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.730
improving the data analysis process,
making data driven decisions, or

4
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.290
for other infrastructure that
supports other data products.

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.950
This is the second version of the class,
and

6
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.140
it's been co-developed by Shaun Cross
who's also in the Department of

7
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.670
Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health.

8
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.590
We've updated much of the old content and
we're including lots of new techniques for

9
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.120
building in-demand data tools in R.

10
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.290
So just to preview some of
the topics we'll be covering.

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.280
With the R Markdown package you can
create websites, PDFs, presentations, and

12
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.980
even e-books from a single file in R in
a way that you're very comfortable and

13
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.510
familiar with.

14
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.130
We'll teach the latest
features of the Shiny package

15
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.120
which you can use to create
interactive web applications in R.

16
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.200
We'll talk about interactive
graphics using Plotly and

17
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.855
Leaflet which allows you to create
beautiful maps that you can share online.

18
00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:07.300
We'll do similar things with the package
GoogleViz which allows you to create maps

19
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.200
and interactive graphics and tables.

20
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.650
We've also added how to use swirl and
swirlify to design courses in R so

21
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.010
that you can share your knowledge.

22
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.480
So thanks for joining and we look
forward to seeing you in the class.
