1
00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:05.834
In this final example, we're going to show
how to use the brush argument in the UI

2
00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:11.401
and the brushedPoints argument in the
server to generate an interactive graphic.

3
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:15.239
And in this case what we're going to
do is highlight points and then

4
00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:20.245
show in a scattered plot, and then show
the fitted line just for those points.

5
00:00:20.245 --> 00:00:24.005
Okay, so this is a nice example of
interactive graphics which I think is one

6
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:27.935
of the key functionalities of Shiny and
one of its primary uses for

7
00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:30.620
those of us that are more
on the analysis side.

8
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.170
Okay, so let's get right.

9
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.860
Okay, so once again I've copied the code
from the R mark down document and

10
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.640
I'm just going to go through
the various lines, and

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.530
then hopefully you'll get the gist, but
I'd like you at home also to try it out.

12
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.619
It only takes a second to copy
the code and run the text, and

13
00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:49.988
I think you'll see a lot more by doing it
yourself, than by having me describe it.

14
00:00:49.988 --> 00:00:54.900
So once again we're going to have
the standard layout, side bar and

15
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.187
in the side panel it's going to
have a display of the Slope,

16
00:00:59.187 --> 00:01:01.797
slopeOut, Intercept, intOut.

17
00:01:01.797 --> 00:01:06.054
So the textOutput (intOut),
we're going to be looking for

18
00:01:06.054 --> 00:01:10.825
that label from the server function,
textOutput (slopeOut),

19
00:01:10.825 --> 00:01:15.680
we're going to looking for
that label from the Shiny server.

20
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.840
Okay, so we got to remember to have both
those, otherwise they won't display right.

21
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.240
And then we want plotOutput, plot1.

22
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.200
We got to make sure that
we're getting the plotOutput,

23
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.250
that we're creating a plot
in the server labeled plot1.

24
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.950
And here is the id brush = brush1.

25
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.850
That label we're going to need
to use that on the server side.

26
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.770
And this brush = and
then brushOpts for the brush options.

27
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.190
Okay, now let's look at the server.

28
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.404
So the Shiny server, input,
takes in input and output lists, okay?

29
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.280
Now, it's going to create a model.

30
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.075
The model is going to be reactive.

31
00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:02.782
It's going to be reactive to the data,
okay?

32
00:02:02.782 --> 00:02:07.474
So this is going to be reactive as we
input new things from the user interface,

33
00:02:07.474 --> 00:02:09.343
this is going to change, okay?

34
00:02:09.343 --> 00:02:14.503
So, and remember it has this notation
of being inside the curly braces

35
00:02:14.503 --> 00:02:19.238
also inside the parentheses for
the reactive function, okay?

36
00:02:19.238 --> 00:02:22.480
brushed_data is just
going to be short hand for

37
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.391
grabbing the data from brush1, okay?

38
00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:29.691
So here's our input, input$brush1, okay?

39
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:36.026
And our brush points are going to
be from the dataset, trees, okay?

40
00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:40.052
The xvar is going to be Girth,
yvar is going to be Volume, okay?

41
00:02:40.052 --> 00:02:44.570
And this will create a little
data frame with Girth and Volume.

42
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.369
And if it's null, I'm sorry,
if there's fewer than two points,

43
00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:54.960
then it's just going to return null, okay?

44
00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.947
And then otherwise,
It's going to fit a linear,

45
00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:06.237
it fit in return a linear model
where Volume is the y variable,

46
00:03:06.237 --> 00:03:12.573
Girth is the x variable, and
the data here is that brushed_data, okay?

47
00:03:12.573 --> 00:03:16.181
And then we don't need to put
a parentheses here because this is inside

48
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:17.903
the reactive statement, okay?

49
00:03:17.903 --> 00:03:22.430
The data is going to be that brushed_data
and this will output that linear model.

50
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.520
Now, if that model is fit or
output$slopeOut,

51
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.370
remember we're looking for
some text with that label.

52
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.110
Okay, here's our renderText telling
Shiny that this is going to be text,

53
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.810
this is going to be rendered
in the user interface.

54
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.960
We've got our curly braces, okay?

55
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.980
And if it's null then it's just
going to say, No Model Found.

56
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.297
Otherwise it's going to say,
it's going to grab the slope term.

57
00:03:49.324 --> 00:03:52.900
Okay, and then same thing for
the intercept.

58
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.252
So the same discussion but it's
going to grab the intercept term, okay?

59
00:03:57.252 --> 00:04:00.557
And here's plot1 which we need to display.

60
00:04:00.557 --> 00:04:02.758
And that's going to be renderPlot, okay?

61
00:04:02.758 --> 00:04:06.900
And it has the reactive notation of having
the curly braces there inside the function

62
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.494
argument.

63
00:04:07.494 --> 00:04:13.989
And it's going to be plot(trees$Girth,
trees$Volume).

64
00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:20.857
So, Girth is x, Volume is y,
it's got nice x labels and y labels, okay?

65
00:04:20.857 --> 00:04:23.940
It's got a title,
it says Tree Measurements.

66
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.170
Let's go down here and
just see if the model is not null,

67
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.720
then it's going to add a line.

68
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.530
Just now,
because it's through the model, right?

69
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:44.460
Through the model, that was fit just
on the point scribe from the brush.

70
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.820
It's going to fit the line, it's
going to plot the line that is only for

71
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.410
those specific data points.

72
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.230
Okay, great.
All right, now,

73
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.390
let's run it and see how it looks.

74
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.250
Okay, I ran the app.

75
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.420
Okay, so now see no model has been fit,
so it is correctly saying,

76
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.720
No Model Found for the Slope, and
No Model Found for the Intercept.

77
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.331
Okay, so
if I highlight this cluster of points,

78
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:17.614
thatâ€™s the line that you would fit and
it gives you the slope and the intercept.

79
00:05:17.614 --> 00:05:21.716
But if I were to grab all of those, that's
the line that and that's the intercept.

80
00:05:21.716 --> 00:05:24.350
Let's grab over here where there's
no point, see what happens.

81
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.041
Okay, it correctly says,
No Model Found and No Model Found.

82
00:05:28.041 --> 00:05:32.436
And if you do the whole thing, everything
except that last point, there it goes.

83
00:05:32.436 --> 00:05:34.640
Let's see if we can get the whole thing,
there we go.

84
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.280
That would be the line that you'd fit
if you grabbed all the data points.

85
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.530
Okay, so this is a nice little interactive
graph that you can create using Shiny.

86
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.400
And I'd like you to go ahead and
try to recreate this example, but

87
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.605
then also maybe try to create your own
example of interactive graph using one of

88
00:05:51.605 --> 00:05:54.920
R's default, kind of canned data sets.

89
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.210
And I think this is one of
the primary uses for Shiny.

90
00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.426
And I think at this point,

91
00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:02.815
you should also have enough to go on
to start making Shiny useful for you.

92
00:06:02.815 --> 00:06:07.207
And there's a lot of other things you
can do with Shiny, such as input and

93
00:06:07.207 --> 00:06:09.227
output data sets, data frames.

94
00:06:09.227 --> 00:06:16.928
You can actually embed RGL, RS 3D graphics
library in a Shiny webpage using WebGL.

95
00:06:16.928 --> 00:06:21.970
But that stuff's maybe a little bit
more fringy, especially the RGL stuff.

96
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.510
Right now, I think you have enough to
get started, and I think you should

97
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.840
definitely should give Shiny a try, and
work it into your standard toolbox.
