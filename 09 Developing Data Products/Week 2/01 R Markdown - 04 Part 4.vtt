00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.720
Okay let's show some formatting options.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.458
So if I just put in Plain text, and

3
00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:15.588
italicized text, and
notice it auto formats it.

4
00:00:15.588 --> 00:00:18.310
Then Bold text.

5
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.730
Or I'm sorry,
it's syntax highlights it I should say.

6
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.800
And then, in 1: 10, here's some code.

7
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.560
Okay, so the code has single right

8
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.250
facing quotation marks,
bold has two asterisk.

9
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.160
Italics has one asterisk.

10
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.380
And then plain of course has nothing.

11
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.670
The asterisk has to be next
to the leading character.

12
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.150
So if you do it like that,
I've noticed it doesn't work sometimes.

13
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.110
So, have it next to the leading character.

14
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.840
I think that's necessary.

15
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.973
And then let's run it.
