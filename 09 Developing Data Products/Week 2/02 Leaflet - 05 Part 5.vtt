00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.900
So sometimes you have enough
points that when they

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.870
all appear close together you
can't really differentiate them.

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.320
And leaflet has a pretty
nice solution to this and

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.950
that's to cluster them together and in a
different resolution they'll break apart.

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.590
So let's go through
an example like this and

6
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.580
I think you'll see
immediately why it's useful.

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.230
Okay, so let's just go through the code.

8
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.580
Let's define a data frame
with 500 latitude and

9
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.940
longitude points that are kind of
close together, okay?

10
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.700
And then, I'm going to take my data frame,
and pass it as the argument to leaflet.

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.210
Then I'm going to pass the output of
the leaflet evaluated at the data

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.140
frame to the addTiles command.

13
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.920
And then I'm going to pass the output
of that to the add markers command and

14
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.620
then it's just going to have
default cluster options, okay.

15
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.590
There we go and look at that.

16
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.690
Now we see the cluster in it.

17
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.700
It gives you the number of
points in this cluster.

18
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.800
So let's look at this big one.

19
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.709
Actually, I want to do this 96 one
since it's, see, there you go.

20
00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:07.263
It's right in the center of Baltimore.

21
00:01:07.263 --> 00:01:08.876
Look at that.

22
00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:10.991
Zowie!
That's cool.

23
00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:15.916
Okay, see how they all bunch back
together at different resolutions?

24
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.750
There is all 500 of them,
they're all in Baltimore.

25
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.720
And as I zoom in,
I could just do this forever.

26
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.840
Okay, all right,
now let's move onto the next thing.

27
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.910
Since it's really quick I'm not
going to really introduce it.

28
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.590
Instead of adding clusters or
standard pop-ups, you can add circles.

29
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.300
And the way to do that is just add circles
markers, see this command right here.

30
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.540
Okay, so let's do the same thing.

31
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.629
Here we're just going to do, A couple

32
00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:55.076
of 20 markers that we're going to add.

33
00:01:55.076 --> 00:01:57.189
And then we're just going to
add circle markers.

34
00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:58.355
Okay, and there they are.

35
00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:00.030
And see now they look like little circles.
