00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.920
Okay, now let's show some r
code that's going to get run.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.660
Okay, so, one two three,
single quotation marks, okay.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.786
We want it to be r code, okay.

4
00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:14.456
And then notice,

5
00:00:14.456 --> 00:00:19.450
it does some nice highlighting to let you
know that you're actually in some r code.

6
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.240
And then, let's do head(mtcars).

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.980
just showing the head
of the dataset mtcars.

8
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.420
You can actually run it here in rStudio
and it will show you down here.

9
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.210
The code being run in the environment
that you have right now

10
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.150
in your interactive r prompt.

11
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.456
But then, you won't actually
run the the whole document.

12
00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:44.330
It's control shift k and
there's my new slide.

13
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.138
Okay, so lets play around with
our options a little bit.

14
00:00:50.138 --> 00:00:54.020
I;ve deleted aa couple of
the rest of the slides just, so

15
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.870
we can just play with this little
extremely simple code example, right here.

16
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.060
So i didn't like when,
let me just show it to you again.

17
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:08.320
When it put this out,
one thing I didn't like- There we go.

18
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.890
I didn't like these comment characters
in front of the output, okay.

19
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.830
So let me just try comment equals and
then,

20
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.350
you can put whatever character you want.

21
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.380
But I want nothing, so
why don't I try that.

22
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.221
See how that looks.

23
00:01:29.203 --> 00:01:32.710
Great, okay and then now,
it looks to a little bit better.

24
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.080
I didn't want that comic character there,
so let's see some other things.

25
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.430
So notice by default,
the knitr options were echo equals false.

26
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.500
So, it didn't show you what code it ran.

27
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.100
It just showed you
the output from the code.

28
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.330
And by the way when you're typing in
your knitr options, it has a bunch.

29
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.040
You can see once you put a comment and

30
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.389
start to type them,
you can see them there.

31
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.670
So if I were for example,
to put echo equals true and then,

32
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.730
redo the presentation, okay so
then, you see head MTcars.

33
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.980
it's actually repeating the code
that I used to generate the output.

34
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.880
So down here is the out put and here's
the code by default in that near option.

35
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.080
Set up just from the auto
completing of the template

36
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.690
that I was using to create these slides.

37
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.620
It set that option but by default
you don't have to have that option.

38
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.280
I could equivalently,

39
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.740
another thing I could have done would
have been exactly the same thing.

40
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.990
Is just gotten rid of this set of
Knitr options at the beginning.

41
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.090
Okay, and then now,
I don't have to say echo is equals true,

42
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.620
because echo equals true
is the default option.

43
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.960
Unless you overwrite it, so there now,
it's automatically sending the code.

44
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.367
Sometimes might just want the code but

45
00:02:56.367 --> 00:03:01.272
not having run it, so,
if I type eval = FALSE, okay.

46
00:03:04.314 --> 00:03:08.490
There's just the code, but
it hasn't been evaluated, okay.

47
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.730
And then you can just put
in a comma here and then,

48
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.420
start to look at all
the different options.

49
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.790
They're all the same options or
it is knitr.

50
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.970
So, it's the same options as
in In any nknitr document but

51
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.308
a lot of these are for figures which
we're going to cover here in a minute.

52
00:03:27.308 --> 00:03:29.202
Okay?

53
00:03:29.202 --> 00:03:34.160
All right, so go ahead and try and

54
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.830
create a slide with some r
code that isn't evaluated.

55
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.295
Some slide with some r
code that is evaluated.

56
00:03:40.295 --> 00:03:45.780
Try and play around.

57
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.470
Make sure you can set
the comment character.

58
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.250
And then, just play around with
some of the Knitr options.

59
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.890
And next, we'll move on to doing
some figures and some other things.
