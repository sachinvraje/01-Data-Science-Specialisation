00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.320
Okay, so
let's look at some of the preamble here,

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.280
this YAML part is surrounded
by three dashes here.

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.900
And so for example the title
you can change the title now,

4
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.410
at this point what you put in in the
dialog box you can change at this point.

5
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.540
Change the author, change the date and
in the output ioslides that also means you

6
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.930
can change the format if you
want it to be slide instead.

7
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.180
The knitr options, by default,

8
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.860
that's just means it's not going to
echo code that you include by default.

9
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.990
Okay, so
now let's just create a new slide.

10
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.200
New slide is two pound signs.

11
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.168
So my new slide.

12
00:00:46.168 --> 00:00:48.348
Okay, now let's knit it.

13
00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:50.748
There it's going.

14
00:00:54.707 --> 00:00:55.620
There we go.

15
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.210
My new slide.

16
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.050
Okay, that's slide two.

17
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.660
So remember,
it starts with my fancy presentation.

18
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.470
My new slide.

19
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.990
Now let's try a slide that
doesn't have a heading.

20
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.750
So this one has some content on it.

21
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.233
And then let's try A slide without.

22
00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:26.876
[NOISE] A slide without a title.

23
00:01:26.876 --> 00:01:32.242
Okay, that's three asterisks.

24
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.385
Now there's my new slides
with some content, and

25
00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:39.220
then now here's a slide without a title.

26
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.690
Okay, so
now let's try putting a subheading.

27
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.140
So that's three pound signs,

28
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.938
which is a top level subheading.

29
00:01:52.938 --> 00:01:54.988
Let's say actually let's
have it like this.

30
00:01:54.988 --> 00:01:57.452
Two pound signs for My title.

31
00:01:57.452 --> 00:02:04.410
Three pound signs for
a top level subheading.

32
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.500
And four pound signs for
a second level subheading.

33
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.910
Now let's try knitting it.

34
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.940
Remember you can also just do
Ctrl+Shift+K and then you can see.

35
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.080
Now let's add some more content.

36
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.056
Let's get rid of these sub headings.

37
00:02:23.056 --> 00:02:29.590
A list, bullet one.

38
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.230
Second one, bullet two.

39
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.770
Okay, and notice those are just two
dashes to start my bulleted list and

40
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:45.638
then if i want an ordered list,
1 is Item 1, 2 is Item 2 and so on.

41
00:02:45.638 --> 00:02:48.630
Okay, or let's spell it Item a and Item b.

42
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.660
So, there's no confusion
over what's going on and

43
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.990
let's just call bullet one and bullet two.

44
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.195
Okay so let's knit those and
see, remember Ctrl+Shift+K.

45
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.130
There we go.

46
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.390
Okay, so now next step.

47
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.630
Go ahead and create some slides,
put some content in with some bullets and

48
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.559
some ordered lists, some titles,
some headings and subheadings.
