1
00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.970
So that was pretty quick,
we were able to actually generate a map,

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.630
a JavaScript widget basically without
actually knowing any JavaScript.

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.200
So just to reiterate the leaflet
function you can think of is

4
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.700
just actually creating like,
if you're familiar with Photoshop,

5
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.760
it's almost like creating a layer or
something like that.

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.241
Okay, it's basically just
creating the background,

7
00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.647
and then you have to add
the actual content on top of it,

8
00:00:28.647 --> 00:00:33.331
so add tiles is adding specifically
the mapping data from Open Street Map.

9
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:38.175
Okay, so then when we display that
map then we have a map that we

10
00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:40.606
can zoom around in, and look.

11
00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:45.171
And you can see how it's kind of
zooming in towards Baltimore there,

12
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:47.650
which is where Hopkins is at.

13
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.040
But we probably actually want
to do things like add markers,

14
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.480
add some direct interactivity.

15
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.930
And so the command to add
a marker is really easy.

16
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.170
It's just add markers, and the first one
we're going to do is just we're going to

17
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.370
add one at a specific longitude and
latitude.

18
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.930
And we are going to give it
a little label, so let's do that.

19
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.892
Okay now, the first thing I want
to mention is that the variable,

20
00:01:12.892 --> 00:01:15.740
my map has already been defined.

21
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.150
So, I'm going to go through
the piping notation once again,

22
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.790
because it's a little bit strange here.

23
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.070
And then after this I'm going to quit
going through the piping notation so

24
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.990
but let's just run it once and see it and

25
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.160
then we'll talk about what
the code is actually doing.

26
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.170
Okay so there we ran it and
now we see here's Johns Hopkins hospital.

27
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.610
And if we click we have
this little marker.

28
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.190
If we click on it we
see Jeff Leek's office.

29
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.120
But let's actually Zoom in and

30
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.780
see if we can find Jeff Leek's Surf
in the internet, there you go.

31
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.350
Actually, so

32
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.260
we're in the Bloomberg's School of
Public Health, there it is right there.

33
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.860
Actually the oldest School of
Public Health in the country.

34
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.220
Okay, all right, so
let's go through the code.

35
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.720
So the type annotation, once again I'm
going to just show you the equivalent.

36
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.950
So remember my map and
I'm going to just redo it.

37
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.050
My map is already defined from up
here from when I ran it from the code

38
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.870
from the first set of slides,
so let me redo that.

39
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.670
So I've overwritten it
back to where it's just

40
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.094
added the content with no markers, okay?

41
00:02:26.094 --> 00:02:31.831
Now this set of commands that we did to
add the marker is equivalent to saying

42
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:37.946
that my map, which I've already defined,
is equal to addMarkers(my_map.

43
00:02:37.946 --> 00:02:41.090
And then I'm just going to copy this code,

44
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.089
because I don't want to have to retype
it and let me bring this up here.

45
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.200
Okay, so this one line here,

46
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.850
these lines are equivalent to this
one line here and there we go.

47
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.960
As you can see it does the same thing.

48
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.210
Okay, so what is it doing?

49
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.730
So first we have to assign my map to
itself which seems ridiculous but

50
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.610
it does just see you can do the piping and
it's just saying I'm piping this.

51
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.090
Variable now into the first argument
of the function add markers, okay.

52
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.450
And then we're still going to
assign it back to the original

53
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.120
variable that's on the left most
side of all my assignments, okay.

54
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.060
And you might think this is a ridiculous
thing to do especially because Brian you

55
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.110
just managed to put this
whole thing in one line.

56
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.500
Why are we placing one line
with all this other lines.

57
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.100
First of all,
I got rid of some line breaks

58
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.500
that probably are better being there.

59
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.030
Anyway, but the reason is because
piping is very powerful and

60
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.870
it's something that you
want to get used to

61
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.840
especially when you're doing chained
operations in deplier for example.

62
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.380
And in some of these mapping
circumstances like this.

63
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.800
You crave this variable and then you're
adding lots of layers and markers and

64
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.870
things like that and

65
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.270
they can get tedious to keep retyping
out the same set of commands.

66
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.290
And so the only reason we actually have
this first line is because we didn't,

67
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.250
we have it separated from
these sets of lines up here.

68
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.210
If you wanted to do it, the way you would
likely do it, you would have done this.

69
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.979
Let me [INAUDIBLE] just give me,
stick with me one second here,

70
00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.190
you would have done something like this,

71
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.905
you would have done my map is that and
then, you would have done like this.

72
00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:42.140
[SOUND] I fail at typing.

73
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.690
Okay there we go.

74
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.060
So this would be a equivalent
total set of plans.

75
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.420
And there you can see now
the chaining is really useful, right?

76
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.313
It's simplifying the code.

77
00:04:54.313 --> 00:05:00.870
Okay, and so here, we just created
it once and we're not having

78
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.170
to reassign this variable over time,
we're just chaining it through each time.

79
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.510
It just creates for a nicer code.

80
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.870
If you've used it in D Prior,
the same rationale for

81
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.210
using it in D Prior applies
here in Leaflet, okay.

82
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.720
And that's why the code is this way and
you should get used to it.

83
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.820
And so from now on we're not
going to talk about this.

84
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.620
We're just going to go
through the Leaflet commands.

85
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.090
Okay, now,
to further expand on the Leaflet commands,

86
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.750
all that we had to do for
the add markers right?

87
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.230
The first thing is is
because of the chaining,

88
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.540
the first argument is going
to be your map variable, but

89
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.210
then after that you just have to
give it the longitude and latitude.

90
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.460
The specific coordinates that you want for
your marker, and

91
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.550
then the pop up just gives
you the text for the pop up.

92
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:51.570
So when you click on it, you actually see
that it says Jeff Leek's office, okay?

93
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.370
All right and so you can think,
you can imagine if you're making a fairly

94
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.580
complicated map, you might have lots and
lots and lots of markers added.

95
00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.069
And we'll go through some examples.
