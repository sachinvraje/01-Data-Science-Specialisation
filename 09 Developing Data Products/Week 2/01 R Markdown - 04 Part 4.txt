Okay let's show some formatting options. So if I just put in Plain text, and italicized text, and
notice it auto formats it. Then Bold text. Or I'm sorry,
it's syntax highlights it I should say. And then, in 1: 10, here's some code. Okay, so the code has single right facing quotation marks,
bold has two asterisk. Italics has one asterisk. And then plain of course has nothing. The asterisk has to be next
to the leading character. So if you do it like that,
I've noticed it doesn't work sometimes. So, have it next to the leading character. I think that's necessary. And then let's run it.
