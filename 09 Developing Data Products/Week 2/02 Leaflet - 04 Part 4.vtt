00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.090
[SOUND] In this next bit of code
we're going to talk about two things.

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.263
We're going to talk about how
to add custom markers and

3
00:00:06.263 --> 00:00:10.674
then we're going to talk about how to
add separate popups for each marker.

4
00:00:10.674 --> 00:00:14.944
So just to give you a sense of what
we want, we want something like this,

5
00:00:14.944 --> 00:00:18.086
where it's the Hopkins logo
at each of the markers.

6
00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:23.610
And then after we add,
we want a separate popup for each marker.

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.920
And so we want something like
this with the markers, and

8
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.270
then I'll show you interactively here in a
second what we're actually getting when we

9
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.400
have a separate popup.

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.650
Okay, so let's go ahead and
try doing that.

11
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.370
Okay, so I think it's actually pretty
quick to get an icon exactly how you want.

12
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.960
So here we're going to just define our
Hopkins icon as grabbing this URL.

13
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.780
Okay, and then you specify the width,
the height, and the anchor points.

14
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.500
And then now let's create hopkinsLatLong,
which is a series of latitude and

15
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.450
longitude values of buildings at Hopkins,
and then we're just going to run it.

16
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.140
So we're going to have our longitude and
latitude values are going to be passed to

17
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.330
leaflet, which is then the output of
the leaflet function with the latitude and

18
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.190
longitude values passed to it is going to
be passed in as the argument to add tiles,

19
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.200
which is going to add the mapping data,
and then it's going to add the markers.

20
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.860
However, we also have some
secondary arguments that we need,

21
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.360
which is that the icon is
going to be the hopkinsIcon.

22
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.100
So let's run all this code,
I'm just going to run it by clicking this

23
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.910
little arrow up here,
and there you see it.

24
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.860
And now instead of these bubbles that we
had before, we have the Hopkins shield.

25
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.290
Now we actually want links for
each of these.

26
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.780
If I click on them now,
they don't do anything.

27
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.902
So what we're going to do is
basically the same thing.

28
00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:46.438
We already have our icon set and we
already have our series of longitude and

29
00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:48.420
latitude values set.

30
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.510
So what we need is a series of sites,

31
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.454
in this case our sites is a vector
of text that give the HTML

32
00:01:56.454 --> 00:02:01.606
commands that give a hyper ref
to each one of the buildings,

33
00:02:01.606 --> 00:02:05.545
or the campus values or
something like this.

34
00:02:05.545 --> 00:02:08.516
And these are in the correct order,

35
00:02:08.516 --> 00:02:13.082
corresponding to the latitude and
longitude values.

36
00:02:13.082 --> 00:02:20.020
And so we're going to take our existing
defined latitude and longitude values.

37
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.610
We're going to pass them to leaflet,
we're going to pass

38
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.510
the output of that command to addTiles,
and then we're going to pass the output of

39
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.420
that command to addMarkers only if we have
our icon set to the icon that we want.

40
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.950
And then popup is going to be
the collection of hopkinsSites.

41
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.630
Okay, so let's run the whole thing,
and there we go.

42
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.280
Okay, now when you click it,
it says Peabody Institute.

43
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.570
And if you click on this link, it takes
you to the Peabody Institute website.

44
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.250
Okay, so pretty handy little map.
