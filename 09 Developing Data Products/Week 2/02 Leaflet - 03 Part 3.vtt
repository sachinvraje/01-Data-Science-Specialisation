00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.140
So, what if you want to
add a lot of markers?

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.640
Well, there's a pretty
simple way to do that,

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.890
you just dump the collection of markers
that you want to add in a data frame.

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.370
So, let's go through
an example of doing that.

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.370
So, let's just create a data frame that
has some random longitude and latitudes.

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.920
We'll set the seed first so

7
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.290
that you get the same answers as
we do when you run the same code.

8
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.160
So then I'm just going to
create this data frame.

9
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.920
And then let me just show you
what the data frame looks like.

10
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.880
It's got more rows than this,
20 rows exactly.

11
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.110
So the latitude and

12
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.420
longitudinal are just columns named
lat and lng in the data frame.

13
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.880
Now, what we're going to do is that
this data frame is going to get,

14
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.330
this is what this code means.

15
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.530
This data frame is going to get
passed as an argument to leaflet.

16
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.472
That'll create our map,
which will have nothing.

17
00:00:56.472 --> 00:01:00.681
So if I were to just run those two bits,

18
00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:05.956
well actually it's
expecting something now.

19
00:01:05.956 --> 00:01:07.796
So let me get out that.

20
00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:13.086
So if I were just run this
part without the pipe,

21
00:01:13.086 --> 00:01:16.960
it's created a blank map.

22
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.500
Now if I were to run this code
where it's taken the data frame,

23
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.820
passed as an argument to leaflet, passed
the output of the argument of leaflet

24
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.630
evaluated at the data frame as
the argument to the addTiles function.

25
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.800
I would get this,
it would have the map, but

26
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.740
remember addTiles just
brings in the mapping data.

27
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.656
It doesn't actually plot anything.

28
00:01:38.656 --> 00:01:43.705
And now if I pass that to the addMarkers
it should add the markers.

29
00:01:43.705 --> 00:01:48.023
Of course you don't have to run it the way
I'm running it in bits and pieces,

30
00:01:48.023 --> 00:01:50.260
you just run the whole code all at once.

31
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.040
Okay?
And there you

32
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.509
see are your multiple markers,
right like that.

33
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.770
So try this out.

34
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.860
Create a data frame with some random
longitude and latitudes in it, and

35
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.230
create a marker.

36
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.110
Create a map with all the markers in it.
