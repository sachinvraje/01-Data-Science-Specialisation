00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.968
An important aspect to developing
data products is having a way

2
00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:07.319
to create interactive maps.

3
00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.790
Leaflet is a JavaScript library, and

4
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.345
then there is an associated Leaflet
package for R that makes use of this

5
00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:19.303
JavaScript library to create interactive
maps within your R environment.

6
00:00:19.303 --> 00:00:23.583
And it's especially convenient within
RStudio because it brings it up in

7
00:00:23.583 --> 00:00:24.831
the RStudio window.

8
00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:28.643
So we're just going to go ahead and
go through some Leaflet examples and

9
00:00:28.643 --> 00:00:32.059
get you started with the bare
minimum to get going on this, and

10
00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.839
I think you'll get
the extended rather quickly.

11
00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:40.273
So, and I should say there's several
other ways to create interactive maps.

12
00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:45.142
GoogleVis is another one,
and so I think Leaflet

13
00:00:45.142 --> 00:00:50.011
is worth covering on its
own just because it's so

14
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:55.140
widely accepted and
widely used among the R crowd.

15
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.586
But again, I would also say, look up, in
our googleVis lecture we also talk about

16
00:00:59.586 --> 00:01:03.403
creating maps using googleVis,
which directly access Google Maps.

17
00:01:03.403 --> 00:01:05.602
And there's still some other ways, but

18
00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:08.196
I think those two might
be the two most popular.

19
00:01:08.196 --> 00:01:10.894
So you want to make sure you install
it first, I won't go through this,

20
00:01:10.894 --> 00:01:12.654
just install.packages("leaflet").

21
00:01:12.654 --> 00:01:17.428
Now let's just go through a code
example where we create our

22
00:01:17.428 --> 00:01:19.344
first Leaflet map in R.

23
00:01:19.344 --> 00:01:24.470
So here I have the R mark down document
for the next couple of slides.

24
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.110
I have the whole R mark down document,
but here's the code for

25
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.658
the next couple of slide.

26
00:01:29.658 --> 00:01:33.575
It has two separate sections, one that
just displays it as code, and one that,

27
00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:35.394
the separate one that evaluates it.

28
00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:37.798
So you have to call library(leaflet).

29
00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:44.786
And then, let me just run these three
commands, and then we'll talk about them.

30
00:01:44.786 --> 00:01:47.610
So, the first thing I want to comment on,
so I ran the commands and

31
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.827
there you can see your map.

32
00:01:48.827 --> 00:01:52.833
And then you can zoom in,
of course, as much as you'd like.

33
00:01:52.833 --> 00:01:58.324
So, it is a, and
this is in the RStudio viewer pane.

34
00:01:58.324 --> 00:02:04.501
So it's not a plot, it's in the kind
of browser viewer that's in RStudio.

35
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:07.744
Okay, so, the first thing I'd like
to mention is something that we're

36
00:02:07.744 --> 00:02:11.107
going to use heavily in these set of
lectures, which is the piping notation.

37
00:02:11.107 --> 00:02:16.850
So, what this code basically
is equivalent to is,

38
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.060
imagine if I wrote up my_map=leaflet(),

39
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.618
okay, and
then my_map=addTiles(my_map), okay?

40
00:02:28.618 --> 00:02:35.407
So let me get rid of my map over here and
then run these three lines, okay?

41
00:02:35.407 --> 00:02:37.138
And you'll see it does the same thing.

42
00:02:37.138 --> 00:02:38.286
It generates the same map.

43
00:02:38.286 --> 00:02:45.197
So this code right here, right,
is identical to this code right here.

44
00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:47.147
That's what the piping notation is doing.

45
00:02:47.147 --> 00:02:50.721
It's taking this output, my_map, and

46
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:56.846
then piping it to this next command,
adding it as the first argument and

47
00:02:56.846 --> 00:03:01.153
then reassigning it to the variable here,
okay?

48
00:03:01.153 --> 00:03:05.360
So, and that's a lot cleaner code,
and easier to read,

49
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.402
once you get to used to it
than what I had written below.

50
00:03:09.402 --> 00:03:15.294
Okay, so the first part leaflet
just kind of generates the map.

51
00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:19.451
And then the addTiles is adding
the first set of content.

52
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:24.685
And we'll talk in a little bit about
how to actually do some useful things,

53
00:03:24.685 --> 00:03:26.604
like add markers and so on.

54
00:03:26.604 --> 00:03:30.307
But just first try to do this,
just generate a world map, zoom around,

55
00:03:30.307 --> 00:03:33.826
make sure you can install a Leaflet
library, and this is step one and

56
00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:36.709
then now we'll go on to some
more interesting things.
