00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.520
Okay, so here's the slide we're at, in
case you're keeping score, now we're just

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.440
going to go through and start doing this
code demonstration of how to do this.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.970
So, the next couple of slides
actually just talk about doing this.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.545
So, instead of going through the slides,
I'm just going to show you in our studio.

5
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.499
It's worth noting that we actually
practice what we preach, and

6
00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.250
here is our slides for
this class written in R Markdown.

7
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.960
But, so here is the RMD file for
the class, but

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.490
we're going to follow through the notes
and create a new presentation.

9
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.880
So look what it says, it says,
File> New File> R Markdown.

10
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.947
Okay, so you could just do that by Alt+F

11
00:00:39.947 --> 00:00:45.000
> F > R Markdown, that is M.

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.950
And then look here,
I'm going to click on Presentation Title.

13
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:56.720
I'm going to call it My Fancy Presentation
and the Author is me.

14
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.200
And then you have different outputs.

15
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.170
So this has a different
presentation style.

16
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.800
I'm just going to stick with
ioslides right now, okay?

17
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.850
And then if you want PDF this requires,
we'll go through this later, but

18
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.850
it requires MiKTeX being setup
on Windows which is a variant.

19
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.560
MacTeX on OS X, and then TeX Live or
something like that on Linux.

20
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.090
So each of these is pretty easy to
install, but they tend to be kind of big.

21
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.910
We'll cover that later on in the lecture.

22
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.090
So right now let's just stick with
the default, which is ioslides,

23
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.600
kind of a format that
was created I think from

24
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.750
one of these Google
presentations at one point.

25
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:46.251
Okay, so there you see it's Untitled1, and

26
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:52.240
that's the name of the file that
contains the R Markdown commands.

27
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.410
But right now,

28
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.020
we're just going to compile it once,
and see what it looks like.

29
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.310
So if you click here and
say Knit the current document, or

30
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.745
it also gives you the command
Ctrl+Shift+K, there we go.

31
00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:13.840
R_Markdown, let me name
it a separate R_Markdown,

32
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.160
I'll name it briansSlides, okay?

33
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.040
There its goes.

34
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.080
It runs it, and there it is.

35
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.250
My Fancy Presentation.

36
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.210
Okay.

37
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.060
So homework number one, just go through
this, create a new presentation,

38
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.030
a new template presentation,
compile it once and

39
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.630
then let's move on from there and
fill it up with some content.
