00:00:04.186 --> 00:00:08.411
So the first structure is if, so this is
a, this, the, the if combined with else

2
00:00:08.411 --> 00:00:12.762
allows you to test logic conditions, and
to let the r program do something, give,

3
00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:16.590
whether or not, depending on whether
that conditions is true or false.

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.870
So if the condition is true then you do
something else you do something else.

5
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.910
That's the typical kind of construct.

6
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.400
The else part is optional, so

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.140
you could just have an if statement
to do something if something is true.

8
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.540
But you can have the else part if you
wanted to do something alternatively.

9
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.330
If you want to do more, there's more
than one possible type of condition you

10
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.200
can tick, you, you want to check.

11
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.340
You can say if, and then,
else, if and then, else.

12
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.940
else, if there can be any number of else,

13
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.590
if conditions in a constraint like this
and the else one has to be at the end.

14
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.580
So there are a couple of different ways
that you can formulate the if else

15
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.110
construct in r, it's a little, this is a
little bit different from other languages.

16
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.830
Case you haven't seen something like this.

17
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.030
So the first is pretty standard if x,
if the con,

18
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.920
if sorry if the symbol x is greater than
3 then you select, you set y equal to 10.

19
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.435
If it's not greater than 3
then you set y equal to 0.

20
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.180
So that's inside the if-else construct,
there's, there's an assignment of y

21
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.250
to a specific type of value depending
on what the value of 3, of x if.

22
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.210
But however in r you can do it
a different way you can say y is

23
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.620
equal to the entire if else construct.

24
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.636
So if x is greater than 3, 10 or

25
00:01:28.636 --> 00:01:30.980
0 depending on whether that
conditions true or not.

26
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.040
So this is a valid formulation also.

27
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.080
Sometimes it's, it's,

28
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.190
it's useful to read this type of
writing because it, it allows you to

29
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.850
realize that the entire if else construct
is all about assigning a value to y.

30
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.620
So as I said before the else clause
is not really necessary you can

31
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.740
always test the condition and

32
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.740
do something and then do nothing if
that condition happens to be false.

33
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.310
So you can and you can just test
multiple conditions in a row if you want
