00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.380
Control structures in R allow you to
control the flow of an R program.

2
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.020
And are very similar to the control
structures that you might see in

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.550
other types of programming languages.

4
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.660
The basic constructs are things like,
if else for testing logical conditions.

5
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.110
The four for
executing a loop a fixed number of times.

6
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.270
While executes a loop
while a condition is true.

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.240
Repeat is a, is a construct
that allows you to just simp,

8
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.580
to immediately execute an infinite loop.

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.320
Break allows you to break
out of any type of loop.

10
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.474
And next,
skips to the iteration we will loop and

11
00:00:35.474 --> 00:00:37.780
return allows you to exit a function.

12
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.056
So, most of these control structures
are not things that you use in

13
00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:45.345
interactive sessions and not like, while
you are typing at the command line in R.

14
00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.232
These are the kinds of things
that typically you would use

15
00:00:48.232 --> 00:00:51.330
when you are writing a R program or
an R function.

16
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.340
It's a little bit more
of a structured format.
