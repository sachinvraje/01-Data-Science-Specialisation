00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:08.140
So, the last function I want to
talk about is the sample function.

2
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.680
And the way, and the sample function
allows you to draw randomly from a,

3
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.560
a specific set of objects
that you specify.

4
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.590
So if you give it a vector of numbers,

5
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.000
it allows you to draw a random
sample from that vector of numbers.

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.550
And so you can kind of create any
arbitrary distribution that you want,

7
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.560
by specifying a vector of objects and
then sampling from it.

8
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.630
So here for example, I'm going to
sample from the integers one to ten.

9
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.710
So I pass the vector of
integers of one through ten.

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.360
And I tell it that I want to
sample randomly four of them,

11
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.290
without replacement.

12
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.400
So so I'm just choosing four random
entries from one to ten, and

13
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.160
here I get 3, 4, 5, 7.

14
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.060
If I do it again, I get 3, 9, 8, 5.

15
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.770
So in this, ex, example, I,

16
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.910
I will, I won't get repeated numbers,
because I'm not sampling with replacement.

17
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.640
I don't have to just sample numbers,
I can sample letters if I wanted to,

18
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.710
so here I'm taking the letters.

19
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.510
A through z, and I'm just going to sample
five of them without replacement, and

20
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.550
I just get q, b, e, x and p.

21
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.300
now, what happens if I
don't specify anything,

22
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.820
I just give it the vector of objects.

23
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.290
So here I'm [INAUDIBLE] passing sample
the vector one through ten, and if I

24
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.890
don't specify anything else, what it does,
is it gives me a permutation of those.

25
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.870
So here the vector one through ten
is just permuted in a random order.

26
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.310
If I call it again I get a,
I get yet another permutation.

27
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.630
So lastly, if I want to sample from one
through ten but with replacement, I can

28
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.090
specify the replace equals true argument,
so now I'm sampling one through ten,

29
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.200
I'm getting a vector of ten numbers
from the vector one through ten, but

30
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.420
because it's with replacement,
I can get repeats.

31
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.440
So, you can see I got eight,
three times and I got nine multiple times.

32
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.450
So, that's how you
sample with replacement.

33
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.480
So, that's a very quick summary
of the simulation functions in r.

34
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.000
You can draw random samples from
specific probability distributions with

35
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.220
the R functions.

36
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.130
So r norm, r plus I'm sorry,
r poiss, r binom we saw already.

37
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.280
All the standard distributions
are going to be built in that you ha,

38
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.540
have, probably you will need.

39
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.740
Things like the Normal, the Poisson and
the Binomial, the Exponential, Gamma, etc.

40
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.590
All those functions are built in.

41
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.610
And you can use the corresponding
r functions to simulate from them.

42
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.249
The sample function can be used to draw
random samples from arbitrary vectors,

43
00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:24.619
if you want to kind of create
your own distribution here.

44
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.770
And it's very important to, to remember
to set the random number generator seed,

45
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.540
anytime you simulate data in r,

46
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.400
so that you can reproduce the results
that you got, at a later date.
