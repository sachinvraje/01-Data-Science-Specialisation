00:00:03.723 --> 00:00:07.530
So there's a special type of object that
we haven't talked too much about yet.

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.120
And these are missing values.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.430
Missing values in R are denoted by either
NA or NAN which we talked about before.

4
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.627
NAN is used for
undefined mathematical operations.

5
00:00:18.627 --> 00:00:21.109
And NA is pretty much used for
everything else.

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.897
And so, there's a function in R called
is.na which is used to test objects to

7
00:00:26.897 --> 00:00:28.085
see if they are NA.

8
00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:30.850
To see if they are missing
values in that object.

9
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.880
There's another function called is.nan
which is used to test for NANs.

10
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.912
So, NA values can have a class, too.

11
00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:39.564
So you can have missing integer val,
values or

12
00:00:39.564 --> 00:00:43.587
you can have missing character values or
missing numeric values etc.

13
00:00:43.587 --> 00:00:46.860
And so
even though it looks like it's all NAs,

14
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.650
the NAs can have different
classes potentially.

15
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.310
And then it's an NA, an NAN value
is considered to be also NA, so for

16
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.150
example, an NAN value,
a NAN value, is missing.

17
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.870
Is considered to be missing.

18
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.490
So, but the reverse is not true.

19
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.857
So an NA value is not necessarily,
an NAN value.

20
00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:09.160
I've got a few different types
of missing values listed here.

21
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.640
So, here I created a vector x
which is 1,2, NA, 10, and 3.

22
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.000
So, now, this is a numeric vector.

23
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.540
And the NA value in here's going to
be a numeric missing value.

24
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.019
So when I call is.na on x,
what it returns is a, is a logical vector.

25
00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:28.138
And the logical vector indicates
whether each element of the vector x

26
00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:29.283
is missing or not.

27
00:01:29.283 --> 00:01:32.104
And so, there's only one missing
element in this vector, and so

28
00:01:32.104 --> 00:01:33.450
that's the third element.

29
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.430
So you can see that the,
that the logical vector that's returned.

30
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.030
The first two are false,
the third is true, and the fourth and

31
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.950
the fifth are false.

32
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.018
So the, the, the element that's true
indicated where the missing value is.

33
00:01:45.018 --> 00:01:46.616
If I call is.NaN on this vector,

34
00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:49.308
you'll see that vector that's
returned is all false.

35
00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:51.257
Because there aren't any NaN values, or

36
00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:55.290
their aren't any MAN values in
this vector so everything's false.

37
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.870
Of course, if I create a vector that
has an end, a NAN value and an, and

38
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.560
an NA value in it.

39
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.024
You'll see that is.na returns true for
both of them.

40
00:02:04.024 --> 00:02:08.310
But is.nan only returns true for
the for the value that's actually NAN.
