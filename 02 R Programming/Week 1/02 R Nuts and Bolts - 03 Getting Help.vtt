00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.700
This video is about how to get help when
learning to use R and taking this course.

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.130
Because of the size of the course and
the number of students that are enrolled,

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.406
it's going to be difficult to be asking
lots of questions on a one on one basis.

4
00:00:14.406 --> 00:00:18.210
And so we're going to have to resort to a
few other tools to get questions answered,

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.230
in particular, the discussion boards and
generally through email.

6
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.560
And so with a certain type of way to
ask questions that I hope to maximize

7
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.100
the chance of you getting the right answer
or the answer that you're looking for.

8
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.510
And so, the main thing to remember is
that asking questions via email is

9
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.880
a little bit different from
asking questions in person.

10
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.860
You don't necessarily know that the people
on the other side, the people that you're

11
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.830
asking, for example, on a discussion
board or on a mailing list, you

12
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.460
don't necessarily know that they have the
same background information that you have.

13
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.368
Furthermore, they may not
know you personally and

14
00:00:51.368 --> 00:00:55.501
so may not know kind of what you mean
when you say certain types of things.

15
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:58.772
So that's kind of important to keep in
mind when you're emailing questions

16
00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:01.240
as opposed to when you're
talking to someone in person.

17
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.338
Keep in mind, of course, that elder people
are very busy, and their time is limited,

18
00:01:06.338 --> 00:01:09.586
and although they may be willing to
help you by answering a question,

19
00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:13.414
they may only have a certain amount of
time to devote to answering that question.

20
00:01:13.414 --> 00:01:16.469
Now I am here, of course,
as the instructor, to help you in all

21
00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.125
circumstances, but furthermore, I may not
be able to answer all possible questions.

22
00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:25.366
And so you're going to want to use the
resources that you have available to you

23
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.450
in this course.

24
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.260
So, in your search for answers, there
are a variety of things that you can do

25
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.730
on your own before venturing off to
ask other people for the answer.

26
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.130
So, if you're going to be emailing a
question to a forum or to a mailing list,

27
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.955
it's important that you search the
archives of that forum for the answers.

28
00:01:42.955 --> 00:01:45.565
So it's possible, and
depending on the size of the forum,

29
00:01:45.565 --> 00:01:49.935
almost very likely that someone has asked
the same question that you're asking.

30
00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:53.075
And if someone else has asked that
question, and it has been answered,

31
00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:55.400
then the answer is going to be
in the archive of that forum.

32
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.500
So if the answer's already there, you've
saved everyone a lot of time, including

33
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.120
yourself, if you search the archives for
the forum and just find the answer.

34
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.490
Of course, the web is very large and
has many answers, and

35
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.700
your first reaction when you have
a question is to search the web.

36
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.460
For given the type of program you're
using, for example, here we're using R,

37
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.150
there are many manuals that are available,
and many answers may exist in the manual.

38
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.410
There's a frequently asked question,

39
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.080
or a FAQ that's on the R website that
you can look for that contains many

40
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.650
questions that are commonly come up on
the mailing lists and on the forums.

41
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.390
Another thing that you might
want to try to do before go

42
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.950
venturing out to ask people for the answer
is to play around with the problem and

43
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.280
try to find the answer by inspecting or
experimentations.

44
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.070
Maybe if you have a function that's not
working right, maybe change the inputs and

45
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.920
see if the outputs change or
if the error message changes.

46
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.950
If you're lucky enough to have a skilled
friend who knows something about R,

47
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.460
you can ask them personally, and
it's usually easier to ask a person

48
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.540
on a one on one basis than to email
a group of people in a forum.

49
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.058
Furthermore, and lastly,
if you're a programmer,

50
00:03:02.058 --> 00:03:05.850
you maybe able to find the answers you're
looking for by reading the source code.

51
00:03:08.698 --> 00:03:12.375
So all the things in the previous
slide are useful things to do

52
00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:15.920
on your own before venturing
out to ask people questions.

53
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.920
However, if you don't find the answer,
it's important to let

54
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.390
other people know that you did all those
other things on the previous slide.

55
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.700
Because if, for example, the answer in
the documentation for the programs, for

56
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.520
example, it's in one of the R
manuals that someone who knows

57
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.650
the answer will usually respond by saying
read the documentation or read the manual.

58
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.990
And then you just wasted
one round of email.

59
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.840
because, you'll have to respond saying,
I did read the manual, and

60
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.450
I didn't find the answer there.

61
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.840
And so, letting people know that
you've done your homework, and

62
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.620
you've looked in a variety of places is
very useful, and it saves a lot of time.

63
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.390
So, here's a very simple example of
what might happen as you're using R.

64
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.790
So, here I'm loading
the data source package, and

65
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.600
then I'm going to load the air
quality data source from that package.

66
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.580
And then I'm going to want to
run the correlation function

67
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.360
on this air quality data frame.

68
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.199
So immediately, I get an error,

69
00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:10.420
it says error in cor(airquality) :
missing observations in cov/cor.

70
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.200
So you might be wondering well, why am I
getting this error, what does it mean?

71
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.440
So the first thing you
can do is go to Google.

72
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.160
And in many circumstances,
Google's going to be your friend.

73
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
And this is no different when you're
learning a new programming language or

74
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.540
when you're learning R.

75
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.180
And so, the easiest thing to do is to
take the error message that you get and

76
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.690
literally cut and
paste it into the search box for Google.

77
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.690
When I search on that,
I get a number of results.

78
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.630
And particularly,
this third result looks very promising.

79
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.350
It looks like someone asked this
question on the R help mailing list, and

80
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.870
so maybe we're clicking on that to see
if someone replied with the answer.

81
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.790
So, when you ask a questions
on a mailing list, so

82
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.020
assuming that Google wasn't
able to help you out,

83
00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.300
if you're going to ask a question on the
discussion board or on the mailing list,

84
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.920
there are a couple things that you need to
think about before you ask that question.

85
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.595
First, is it possible to
reproduce your problem?

86
00:05:07.595 --> 00:05:12.590
So, if someone else can reproduce your
problem, it makes it a lot easier for

87
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.880
that other person to figure out
what the solution is going to be.

88
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.922
And so if you can provide some code or
a very simple example that will reproduce

89
00:05:20.922 --> 00:05:25.827
your problem, this will be enormously
useful to everyone else involved.

90
00:05:25.827 --> 00:05:29.382
And if you don't do this, typically, the
first response that you'll get will be,

91
00:05:29.382 --> 00:05:32.180
can you please provide
a reproducible example?

92
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.500
Second, it's important to understand
what you expect the output to be,

93
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.370
because if your expectation is wrong,
then of course, it may or

94
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.520
may not be an error, depending on
what your expectation should be.

95
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.760
So what you expect the output to be
will indicate kind of what the nature of

96
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.810
the error and what needs to be solved.

97
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.460
And then given your expectation, you need
to say, well, what do you see instead?

98
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.470
So what was the thing that was
unexpected that gave you the question?

99
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.840
Other information that's important to
specify when you're asking a question

100
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.560
is the version of the product
you're using, so for example,

101
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.990
what version of R are you using?

102
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.650
What version of the R
packages you're using,

103
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.760
if it's specific to a given package?

104
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.370
Because often there may be legitimate bugs
in older versions of R or R packages,

105
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.040
and your problem might be solvable if
you just upgrade to the latest version.

106
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.750
So if you're using the latest version
of R, it's important to mention that.

107
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.670
Sometimes it's important to know what
operating system you're using, so

108
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.930
whether you're using a Mac, or Windows,
or Linux, or some other UNIX machine.

109
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.930
Some problems can be traced to the type
of operating system that you're using.

110
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.461
And depending on
the question that you have,

111
00:06:36.461 --> 00:06:38.609
there may be additional information
that you need to provide.

112
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:45.277
So when you send an email to a forum or
to a discussion board,

113
00:06:45.277 --> 00:06:50.320
it's important to get as much useful
information in there as possible.

114
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.850
And this includes the subject line for
the email.

115
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:58.170
So there's a couple of examples of subject
lines that could range in usefulness.

116
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.281
So the first one is probably
the least useful, it just says Help!

117
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:02.450
Can't fit linear model!

118
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.050
So here,
there's very little information here.

119
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.960
All I know is that there's some
problem with linear models.

120
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.170
I don't know anything else about
what the user's problem is.

121
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:16.673
So the second version is much better,
it tells me that on R version 2.15.0,

122
00:07:16.673 --> 00:07:19.545
the lm() function produces a seg fault,

123
00:07:19.545 --> 00:07:23.320
which meaning that R crashes,
with a large data frame.

124
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.469
And furthermore,
it says I'm using Mac OS 10.6.3.

125
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:29.616
So here, I've got the operating system,

126
00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:32.896
the version of the operating system,
I've got the version of R,

127
00:07:32.896 --> 00:07:38.150
I've got what function I'm using, and I've
got a summary of what actually happened.

128
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.750
So just a little bit smarter than that
would just be to reformat the message, so

129
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.710
that I specify what version
of R I'm using, the function,

130
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.530
and then the version of
the operating system.

131
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.863
And then so that gives me the context,
and then after that, I can say

132
00:07:50.863 --> 00:07:55.320
what the problem was, which in this case,
was a seg fault on a large data frame.

133
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.897
So here, the important
details are right away put in

134
00:07:58.897 --> 00:08:03.219
the subject header before I even
get to the body of the message.

135
00:08:06.092 --> 00:08:10.066
So, a couple things that you definitely
want to do when you're asking a question

136
00:08:10.066 --> 00:08:13.820
on a forum or a mailing list, first is
to describe the goal, not the steps.

137
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.610
So you may have many,
many steps that you're going through, and

138
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.390
maybe one of those steps
is causing a problem.

139
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.010
It's useful for other people to know what
the bigger picture is in terms of what

140
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:28.590
you're trying to do, because for example,
they might have a better idea about how to

141
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.900
go about achieving that goal,
which may be faster or simpler, and

142
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.330
may work around whatever
problem you're having.

143
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.656
So, describe the ultimate goal, and
then talk about what the problems are.

144
00:08:37.656 --> 00:08:41.764
And don't just narrow it down to
the one little step that you're having

145
00:08:41.764 --> 00:08:43.420
a problem with.

146
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.970
Be explicit about your questions.

147
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:49.305
So remember, provide details
about what you're trying to do.

148
00:08:49.305 --> 00:08:52.382
And you have to provide the minimum
amount of information necessary, so

149
00:08:52.382 --> 00:08:55.670
not the maximum amount of information,
the minimum amount of information.

150
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.398
And so it's common to see on some
mailing lists posts that lots of

151
00:08:59.398 --> 00:09:02.490
output is produced, and
that's not very helpful.

152
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.390
because volume doesn't really help you
in terms of diagnosing the problem.

153
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.150
You need to know exactly, to narrow down
kind of where the problem is going to be.

154
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:14.184
So, and of course a couple of things,
being courteous never hurts anyone.

155
00:09:14.184 --> 00:09:18.630
And promoting civility on mailing
lists is always a nice thing.

156
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:22.160
And if you find the solution later on,
it's useful for

157
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.340
everyone else in the community if
you follow up with the solution and

158
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.390
explain kind of what the problem was and
how you solved it.

159
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.490
A couple of things you definitely do
not want to do when posting to a forum,

160
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.850
you don't want to claim
that you've found a bug.

161
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:42.045
This happens all the time, and
usually, I'd say 99 times out of 100,

162
00:09:42.045 --> 00:09:44.955
it's not a bug, and
it's just a misunderstanding about what

163
00:09:44.955 --> 00:09:48.285
should have happened, so
a mistake in the expectations of the user.

164
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.205
Grovelling is a substitute for
doing your homework,

165
00:09:51.205 --> 00:09:54.907
that's not usually looked well upon,
and you definitely shouldn't do that.

166
00:09:54.907 --> 00:09:59.090
Definitely don't want to post homework
questions on the mailing list or forums,

167
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:04.260
and the reason is because people who write
the homework questions are reading those

168
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.230
mailing lists and will be able to identify
all homework questions without a doubt.

169
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.270
So we've seen them all,

170
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.810
don't bother trying to get the answers
to your homework on mailing lists.

171
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.230
Don't ever email multiple
mailing lists at once.

172
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.210
So this is a little bit annoying,
because people will subscribe to different

173
00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:24.010
mailing lists and will be getting
your message more than one time.

174
00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.910
It's important to figure out which mailing
list is the most appropriate mailing list

175
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:32.610
for your question and then send
the message to that mailing list or forum.

176
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.719
And then lastly, don't ask others to debug
your code without giving some sort of hint

177
00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:38.271
as to what the problem might be.

178
00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:42.058
So it's very difficult when a person
posts a long listing of code and

179
00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:46.530
says there's a problem in here somewhere,
I don't know where, please help.

180
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.154
It's better to kind of specify
where you think the problem is and

181
00:10:50.154 --> 00:10:53.789
what you're trying to do, so
that everyone can save some time.

182
00:10:56.517 --> 00:11:00.658
So this is just a very brief case
study on using a recent post to

183
00:11:00.658 --> 00:11:02.620
the R-devel mailing list.

184
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.200
So, the R-devel mailing
list is an email list for

185
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.510
people who are doing development work in
R, so either they're developing packages,

186
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.650
or they're making modifications
to the R source code itself.

187
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:14.310
And so

188
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.460
the subject was, so you can see from the
subject that it's going to be a problem.

189
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.400
The subject is large dataset- confused.

190
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.540
So right away, you know that there's not
that much information here to go on.

191
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.310
It's not clear what the problem is.

192
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.900
In the message, it says,
I'm trying to load a dataset into R, but

193
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.110
I'm completely lost.

194
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:33.010
This is probably due mostly to the fact
that I'm a complete R noob, but

195
00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.960
it's got me stuck in a research project.

196
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.790
So you have to ask yourself,

197
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:40.400
what do I know about this person's
problem from reading this message?

198
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:46.770
And the truth is very little, and so
the response was somewhat predictable.

199
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.790
Basically, the first person
response said yes, you are lost.

200
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:55.340
And then there is a pointer to the posting
guide, which everyone should read before

201
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.402
sending an email to the mailing list,
and then also a list of manuals.

202
00:11:59.402 --> 00:12:03.130
And so, here, you can see that one
round of email is immediately wasted,

203
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:07.070
because probably the answer to
the question was in one of the manuals,

204
00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:12.560
and so, the user didn't specify whether
he or she had already done that.

205
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.946
So, in terms of what went wrong with
this little exchange, first, of course,

206
00:12:15.946 --> 00:12:18.334
the question was sent to
simply the wrong mailing list.

207
00:12:18.334 --> 00:12:21.885
The R-devel mailing list is for
development questions and for

208
00:12:21.885 --> 00:12:24.140
more sophisticated programmers.

209
00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.710
It's not really a mailing list for
questions for,

210
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.010
as this person stated, noobs.

211
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.992
So that question really should have
gone to the R-help mailing list,

212
00:12:31.992 --> 00:12:33.900
where it would have been better received.

213
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.960
However, in addition to that,
the email subject was very vague,

214
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.450
it was not clear what the problem was.

215
00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.090
The question itself was very vague.

216
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.524
There was no reproducible example there.

217
00:12:42.524 --> 00:12:43.787
There was not possible for

218
00:12:43.787 --> 00:12:48.480
other people who are reading the email to
reproduce what that person's problem was.

219
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.250
And there was no evidence that any
effort was made to solve the problem.

220
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:56.020
So there is no evidence that they searched
the web or checked the manuals or

221
00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.480
experimented with the problem, or anything
like that, or even looked at the forums.

222
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.353
And so, the end result was
a complete recipe for disaster, and

223
00:13:04.353 --> 00:13:08.750
it's likely that this person did not
get the answer to their question.

224
00:13:11.284 --> 00:13:14.415
So a couple places to turn for
this course, first of all,

225
00:13:14.415 --> 00:13:18.657
the class discussion board I think will
be the most useful because your fellow

226
00:13:18.657 --> 00:13:23.390
students can help you out there, and I can
respond to you on the discussion board.

227
00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:27.870
Outside of class, there's the R help
mailing list, which I just described.

228
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.760
And you can post to this mailing list
as well, and it's useful to, of course,

229
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.250
follow all the rules that
we talked about just now.

230
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.370
And depending on what other
products you might be working on,

231
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.403
there are other project-specific mailing
lists for other types of software.

232
00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:44.241
And so this talk was inspired by
Eric Raymond's posting called,

233
00:13:44.241 --> 00:13:48.310
How to ask questions the smart way,
and I encourage you to read that.

234
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.380
It's much longer,
it has a lot of other useful tips.
