00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.440
Hey everyone welcome to R Programming.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.660
This is the second course in the Data
Science Specialization and, as

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.750
the title suggests, we will be focusing on
R as a programming language.

4
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.720
So in this course, we'll kind of start
with the basic

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.940
building blocks of R kind of different
data types in the

6
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.840
very, kind of low level details and then
we'll kind of

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.870
move on to writing and formulating our
programs or our scripts.

8
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.300
This involves things like control
structures and writing r

9
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.450
functions and kind of doing some basic
operations on data.

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.120
And then, and then we'll talk about kind
of profiling your code, some of the

11
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.950
tools for debugging and kind of how to
work,

12
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.350
how to work through longer pieces of code.

13
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.280
And then so after this course is done, I
think you'll

14
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.540
have a pretty solid grasp of R as a
programming language.

15
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.860
We're not going to cover every last
feature of the R packages because of

16
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.670
their and some of the other courses in the
specialization you'll learn more about,

17
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.720
for example, how to use the graphics
system, how to make plots, how

18
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.860
to use some of the packages for

19
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.430
things like statistical inference and
machine learning.

20
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.090
And so that will be covered in other
classes.

21
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.340
So, the pur, purpose of this class is to
really kind of

22
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.630
get you into R programming, in

23
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.890
particularly or if you're not very
familiar

24
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.390
with the language and to make sure you
kind of kind of get a

25
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.870
hand, get a sense of the on the of the
nuts and bolts.

26
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.460
So I hope you enjoy it.

27
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.070
And I think after this course is done
you'll be ready to move

28
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.780
on to a bunch of, to mo, to the other
courses in the specialization.
