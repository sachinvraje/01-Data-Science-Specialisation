00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.510
In this video I want to talk about two
things.

2
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.740
How to set your working directory and how
to edit R code files in Windows.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.960
So you can see I've got R started up here
and the first

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.360
thing you're going to want to do is figure
out what your working directory is.

5
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.580
Because the working directory is where R
finds all of

6
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.720
its files for reading and for writing on
your computer.

7
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.310
So you can find out what your working
directory

8
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.098
is currently set to be by using the getWD
function.

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.040
You can see its said to be c colon slash
user slash rdpeng slash documents.

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.730
This may differ on your computer depending

11
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.800
on what version of Windows you're using
and,

12
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.690
and what hardware you're using but there
will

13
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.968
be some directory probably on your c
drive.

14
00:00:44.968 --> 00:00:49.550
Now it, the reason why it's important to
know and to

15
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.220
set your working directory, is because
when you read data or when

16
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.120
you write things out, using functions like
Read or Write CSV

17
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.770
they will be read or written to your home,
your working directory.

18
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.015
So for example if I do something like

19
00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:07.450
read.csv I want to the read let's say
mydata.csv.

20
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.950
If the file is not in my working directory
you'll get an error one

21
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.790
that looks much like this because it can't
find the file in the working directory.

22
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.230
So one possibility is that you can, if you
know where

23
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.820
this file is, you can move it to your
working directory.

24
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.140
Or you can change your working directory
to be wherever this file happens to be.

25
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.020
So I can go to the file menu here and
choose Change dir.

26
00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:34.830
And I'm going to go into my local disk
here, go to users, RD Peng.

27
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.960
And I'll go to my desktop here.

28
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.540
So now if I type DIR, I'll get a list of
the files that are on my desktop here.

29
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.540
You can see that, oh, lo and behold, here
is my mydata.csv file.

30
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.370
So now I can see read.csv and then
mydata.csv.

31
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.190
You can see that the data will be printed
to the

32
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.630
console because now it can find the file
in my working directory.

33
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.060
So one nice thing, one thing that I

34
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.720
suggest that you do for this course is
perhaps

35
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.150
create a single directory or single folder
where you

36
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.580
can put all of your materials for the
course.

37
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.925
And not have to worry about them being
scattered all over the place.

38
00:02:15.925 --> 00:02:19.950
Anytime you download something from the
website or

39
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.200
create a new file it's probably best to
store

40
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.070
it all in one folder so that you don't
have to be searching all over for it.

41
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.610
That way you can always set your working
directory to be that,

42
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.980
to be that directory and not have to worry
about changing it.

43
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.730
So I'm going to minimize R here for a
second.

44
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.500
I'm going to create a folder on the

45
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.640
desktop, called I'll just call it
Coursera.

46
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.080
And then I'm going to use this folder for
everything that I do in this course.

47
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.900
So if I go back to R here, I can say

48
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.220
change working directory again, Change
dir, and go to Local Disk.

49
00:02:54.324 --> 00:02:57.702
Users RD Peng.

50
00:02:57.702 --> 00:03:02.175
Now this folder is on my desktop, so
Desktop, and then it's Coursera here.

51
00:03:02.175 --> 00:03:04.089
So now if I say getwd and see

52
00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:09.000
the working directory has changed to this
Coursera folder.

53
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.160
So one of the things you're going to have
to do

54
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.080
a lot of in the class is to write R code.

55
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.362
In order to write R code, you'll need to
be able to use a text editor.

56
00:03:17.362 --> 00:03:20.380
Luckily R comes with a rudimentary text
editor

57
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.400
which will be definitely sufficient for
this course.

58
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.010
So you can load up the text editor by
going to File and saying New Script.

59
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.780
And this will give you a blank window that
you can use to write R code.

60
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.600
So I'm going to write a simple function
here.

61
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.595
It's going to be myFunction.

62
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.680
It's not going to take any arguments.

63
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.337
And all it's going to do, it's going to
simulate some normal random variables.

64
00:03:43.337 --> 00:03:46.246
[BLANK_AUDIO]

65
00:03:46.246 --> 00:03:48.910
And then it's going to take the mean of
those guys.

66
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.780
Alright.

67
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.390
So this is a simple function.

68
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.180
Now the question is how do I get this R
code

69
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.120
into my R console so that I can actually
use the function?

70
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.430
because you'll notice that I go into the R
console here.

71
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.610
I type myFunction.

72
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.170
It's the, I can't find the function
because I haven't loaded it into R yet.

73
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.300
If I type LS, you'll see that there's
nothing in my workspace right now.

74
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.200
Because I haven't loaded any R code into
there.

75
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.070
So how do I get the R code into the R
console?

76
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.870
Well there's two ways if you just have a
little bit of

77
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.290
code like this function over here, I can
click into my R editor.

78
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.560
And just hit Ctrl+A to select all and then
Ctrl+C to copy.

79
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.160
Then I click back into the console and I
can hit Ctrl+V to paste.

80
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.640
Now I've just pasted the code into R and
you'll see that if I

81
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.660
type LS I've got my myFunction there, I
can execute it by just calling it.

82
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.825
And you'll see it'll give you the mean of
100 random normal var random variables.

83
00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.380
If I do it again, it'll give me a slightly

84
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.170
different number because it'll simulate a
different set of numbers.

85
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.390
The other thing you can do is go into my R
editor and you can go to the File menu.

86
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.700
Then you click Save As.

87
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.730
So now if you save you can hit save as you
can save

88
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.720
the file into your Coursera folder here
which I'm going to do right now.

89
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.260
And you can save it as whatever name you
want.

90
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.126
So I'm going to call it my Code.r.

91
00:05:12.126 --> 00:05:15.090
.r is conventional for the extension.

92
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:24.980
So now if I type DIR, excuse me in my
console window here, you'll see that

93
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.380
there's a file called mycode.r and you can

94
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.915
load this into R using the source
function.

95
00:05:29.915 --> 00:05:34.440
So I can say mycode, .r.

96
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.230
And that loads the, all the code that is
in this file.

97
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.670
Of course, that's just the myFunction, so
I haven't done anything new here.

98
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.530
But let's say I want to add another
function here.

99
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.280
We'll say second for my second function.

100
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.708
And it'll take an argument x.

101
00:05:47.708 --> 00:05:51.270
And it'll take the x, and it'll add, a
little bit of noise to it.

102
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.800
So, with, with the R norm function.

103
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.450
Okay, so now, I've got two functions here.

104
00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.220
I can save my file with this little disk
icon.

105
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.670
Or I can go to file men-, the File menu,
and hit Save.

106
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.570
And I'm going to source this file again.

107
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.250
Now when I type LS, you'll see that I've

108
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.970
got this second function there, and I type
second.

109
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.830
Let's say four.

110
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.840
I get a number that four plus little bit
of random noise.

111
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.080
So if I get four again I'll say the same
thing will happen.

112
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.960
I can say four through ten.

113
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.500
And it'll give me each one of those
numbers

114
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.850
with a little bit of random noise added
on.

115
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.540
So that's how I edit code and that's how I
load the code into R.

116
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.590
Every time you edit your file in the
editor you have to save it.

117
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.010
And then if you want that code to be
available in R you

118
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.260
have to use the source function to source
that file back into R.

119
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.700
You don't have to use a single file.

120
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.760
You can add a new file.

121
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.526
So you can say New Script.

122
00:06:46.526 --> 00:06:47.630
It'll open another window.

123
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.900
You can save this to be a different file
if you want

124
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.910
so that way you can separate

125
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.680
code for different projects or different
assignments.

126
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.250
If you close the file here, you can always
open it back up again

127
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.550
by hitting Op, the Open button and you can
see myCode is right there.

128
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.260
And if I open it up, you'll see you'll
have all your code right back there again.

129
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.800
So that's how you edit code in R there's,
now there's many other

130
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.260
text editors that you might see on the web
that you can download.

131
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.470
And those are fine to use but they're not
really necessary.

132
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.370
The text editor that comes with R should
be sufficient for this course.
