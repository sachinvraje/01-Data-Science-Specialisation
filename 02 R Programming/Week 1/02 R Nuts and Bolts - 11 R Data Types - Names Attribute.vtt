1
00:00:04.706 --> 00:00:07.070
R objects can also have names.

2
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.730
So this not true for just data frames.

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.990
It's true for all r objects.

4
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.590
And this can be very useful for writing
readable code and self describing objects.

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.060
So for example, I'm creating a vector
that's an integer sequence 1, 2,

6
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.280
3 and by default, there's no name.

7
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.720
So when I call the names function on x,
it gives me a null value.

8
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.840
However, I can, I can give a name
to each element of the vector x.

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.580
So for example, if I,
I can say the first element's called food,

10
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.090
the second element's called bar, and
the third element's called norf.

11
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.450
So now when I print out my x vector,
I get a vector 1, 2, 3 but

12
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.640
then each one has a name over it,
which is the name I just specified.

13
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.220
And so
when I call the names function I get the,

14
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.039
the names that are associated with each
element of the vector foo, bar, and norf.

15
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.270
Lists can also have names.

16
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.330
And so for example here I'm creating
a list with the list function

17
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.900
where the first element is called a,
the second element is called b, and

18
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.440
the third element is called c.

19
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.840
And so when I print out the list, it
prints out the names of each element and

20
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.350
the values associated with those names.

21
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.450
Finally matrices can have names.

22
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.630
These are called dim names.

23
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.420
So here I created a matrix
from the sequence 1 to 4.

24
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.180
It's a two by two matrix.

25
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.830
And so the, when, when I use the dim
names function I pass it a list.

26
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.360
Excuse me, I assign it a list.

27
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.510
Where the first element of the list is
the, is the vector of row names and

28
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.260
the second element of the list
is a vector of column names.

29
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.990
So here I want to name the rows a and b,
and I want to name the columns c and d.

30
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.930
So that's what I passed to
the dim names function.

31
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.380
And now when I print out my matrix
I can see that the row names and

32
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.140
the column names are labeled as I wanted.
