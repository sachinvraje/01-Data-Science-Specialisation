00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.765
In this video I'm going to talk about how
to install R studio for the Mac.

2
00:00:07.765 --> 00:00:11.070
It's a very simple process and it only
involves just a few steps.

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.940
The one thing I'll say though is that you
must

4
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.910
have R already installed before you can
install R studio.

5
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.480
So once you've installed R already you can

6
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.280
go to the RStudio web site, which is
rstudio.com.

7
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.240
And you can see down

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.240
here on the lower left, there's a green
button

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.100
that that directs you to, to kind of
download RStudio.

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.690
So here there's two versions of RStudio,
Studio that you can download.

11
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.000
One is for the desktop and one is for the
server down here.

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.430
Now you, we're not going to be talking
about the server version at all here.

13
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.560
So you just want to download the desktop
version.

14
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.560
So that's this button right here.

15
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.600
So the website should detect automatically

16
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.150
what type of operating system you're
running.

17
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.000
So here I'm running a Mac, and so it
recommends this

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.300
Mac OS X version, so I'm just going to
download that right now.

19
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.090
And you'll see the download meter go.

20
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.000
Once that's finished downloading you can
go to the

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.390
Downloads folder, and it should be the
leftmost thing here.

22
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.240
So I'm just going to click on it to
install it.

23
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.190
And then just like any other Mac
application, all you have to do to install

24
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.970
it is drag it into the Applications
folder, so I'm going to do that right now.

25
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.680
And it's already done.

26
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.637
So I can just go into the

27
00:01:22.637 --> 00:01:28.990
Applications folder here find RStudio,
double-click on it.

28
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.130
I'll say yes, I want to open this
application.

29
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.313
And there you go, you're running RStudio.
