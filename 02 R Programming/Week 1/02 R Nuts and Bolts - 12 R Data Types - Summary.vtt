00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:07.550
So, that's kind of a whirlwind tour of
the different basic data types in R.

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.030
So far, we've talked about
the atomic classes in numeric,

3
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.610
logical, character, integer,
and complex vectors.

4
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.310
We talked about how vectors can only
have elements of the same class and

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.720
the main exception to that is lists which
can have elements of different classes.

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.610
There are factors which are used for, for
coding categorical data, with ordered and

7
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.990
unordered data.

8
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.830
There are missing values that
are represented by NAs, and NANs.

9
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.070
Data frames are used to store tabular data
or each COM can be of a different class.

10
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.710
And finally, all our R objects
can have names which mean usul,

11
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.120
which can be useful for
creating self-describing data.
