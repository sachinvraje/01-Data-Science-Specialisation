00:00:03.923 --> 00:00:07.800
In this video, I'm going to briefly
show how you can install R on the Mac.

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.100
It's a very simple process,
it only takes a few steps.

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.022
So the first thing you need to do is
open your web browser and go to CRAN,

4
00:00:17.022 --> 00:00:20.830
this is the Comprehensive R Archive
Network, and you'll see that there

5
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.930
are a number of options for you to
download here for different platforms.

6
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.480
So we're going to download
the Mac platform here.

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.860
So we can go to Download R for the Mac,
you want to download this package file

8
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.730
here, so just click on this and you'll see
that the download meter will start going.

9
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.570
It might take a few minutes depending on
the speed of your internet connection, so

10
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.320
just be patient.

11
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.930
It's finished downloading.

12
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.460
I'm just going to open up here,

13
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.230
the package, and you can see it
will start the installer, and

14
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.490
it will guide you through all of
the steps you need to install R.

15
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.250
I'll click Continue here and

16
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.590
this is just the description of
what's going to get installed.

17
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.210
Hit Continue.

18
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.110
The software license agreement is the
GNU General Public License Version 2, so

19
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.100
you should agree to the license,
after having read it, of course.

20
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.940
Then you can just click Install here and
you might have to type in your

21
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.910
administrator password, so
just go ahead and do that.

22
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.160
It'll start installing
the files on your computer.

23
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.520
Now it's finished, I can hit Close,
then it will be in my applications folder.

24
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.800
So I can just go to my applications
folder, which is right here.

25
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.365
They're in alphabetical order, so I'll
just scroll down to R and there it is and

26
00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:34.405
there you have it.

27
00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:37.325
You've installed R on your computer and
now you can go ahead,

28
00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:41.235
you can just use it directly, or if you
want to, you can install an interface,

29
00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:43.005
like R Studio, if you like.
