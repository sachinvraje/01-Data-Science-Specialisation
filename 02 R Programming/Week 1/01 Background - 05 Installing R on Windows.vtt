00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:08.320
I just want to briefly describe how
to install R for a Windows machine.

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.770
So the first thing you need to
do is launch your web browser.

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:11.930
So I'll do that here.

4
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.370
I'm using Chrome but
it really doesn't matter.

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.973
And you need to go to the Comprehensive
R Archive Network, or CRAN, so

6
00:00:16.973 --> 00:00:18.324
let's type that in here.

7
00:00:21.506 --> 00:00:23.990
And you'll see that at the top
there's three options.

8
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.710
There's Linux, a Mac and Windows.

9
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.780
So you can go to the Windows version here.

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.918
And you want to click
on the base link here.

11
00:00:29.918 --> 00:00:33.592
So you can just click on this link and
the download will start.

12
00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:36.080
And so depending on how fast
your Internet connection is,

13
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.870
this might take a few minutes.

14
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.150
Okay, so the download's finished.

15
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.320
I'm going to click on this.

16
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.040
And so, you can choose your language here.

17
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.970
There are a number of choices in terms of
the translations that you can choose from.

18
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.970
So I'm going to choose English
because that's my language.

19
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.600
And then you can just click
through the installer.

20
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.140
It'll kind of walk you through
the various steps, and so

21
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.400
we'll do that right now just
to see what the options are.

22
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.690
If you click on Next,
you have to agree to the license,

23
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.820
which is the GNU General Public License.

24
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.370
So feel free to read it and
then click on Next.

25
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.970
Then usually the default
installation directory is fine, so

26
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.060
I'm going to go through this.

27
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.940
The default user installation is fine.

28
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.940
There are other kind of installation
setups that you can choose from.

29
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.580
If you know you have a 32-bit machine,

30
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.540
it may be an older macihne,
you could click on that.

31
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.480
By default it will install both versions,
so

32
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.800
you don't have to really worry about that.

33
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.380
So, just click through Next on this one.

34
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.340
And you can choose to
take all the defaults or

35
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.710
you can try to customize your start-up.

36
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.790
I'm going to customize the start-up just
so you can see what the options are here.

37
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.060
So, this option here asks you whether
you want an MDI or SDI interface, so

38
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.260
what that means basically is do you
want R to kind of run in one big window.

39
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.900
You know, with kind of different
sub-windows inside of a big window.

40
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.510
Or do you want it to run kind
of like separate windows?

41
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.560
I prefer to use the STI mode, so
the console will be in one window and

42
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.830
the kind of graphics window
will be a separate window.

43
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.772
I just kind of,
I feel I like that a little bit better,

44
00:02:02.772 --> 00:02:03.773
it's easier to work with.

45
00:02:03.773 --> 00:02:06.160
So I'm going to click on the SDI option.

46
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.280
And then you can choose how you
want to look at your help files.

47
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.697
The HTML help is a little bit nicer,
it's prettier to read, and

48
00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:18.240
the plain text help is,
well, it's just plain text.

49
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.650
So maybe I'll just click on
plain text just to be different.

50
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.850
And then you can choose whether you want
Standard or Internet2 Internet access.

51
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.840
This, generally speaking, you should not
mess with, so you just click on Next.

52
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.160
You can create a shortcut in the start
menu, so that's usually a good idea.

53
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.470
And you can usually choose the defaults
here, in terms of creating a desktop icon.

54
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.280
Unless your desktop is very cluttered and
you want to avoid that.

55
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.640
So these defaults are fine,
so I'll click on Next.

56
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.129
And then it will start installing
the files on your computer.

57
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.570
So now it's done.

58
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.340
And we can just click on Finish here.

59
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.170
And you've now installed
R on your computer.

60
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.410
And I see I've got a desktop icon here.

61
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.070
So I'll just double-click on that.

62
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.620
And there we are, we're running R.
